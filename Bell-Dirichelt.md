These notes can be slotted into your existing Lambert-series course, roughly around Week 5–6, as a bridge between the algebra of multiplicative functions and the analytic behavior of Dirichlet series.

🔶 Advanced Notes: Multiplicative Structures, Bell Polynomials, and Log Differentiation of Dirichlet Series

⸻

1. Completely vs. “Left” Multiplicative Functions

An arithmetic function f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C} is:
	•	multiplicative if f(mn)=f(m)f(n) whenever (m,n)=1;
	•	completely multiplicative if f(mn)=f(m)f(n) for all m,n.

The term “left multiplicative” (sometimes used in operator or convolutional contexts) can refer to:
fg = f \quad\text{or}\quad (fg)(n)=f(n)
meaning f acts as a left identity under Dirichlet convolution on a certain subalgebra.

Equivalently, a left completely multiplicative function can mean one satisfying
(f*g)(n)=f(n)g(1)
for all multiplicative g; it “commutes” only when multiplied on the left.
This interpretation aligns with operator semigroups acting on arithmetic functions.

In the Dirichlet algebra (\mathcal{A}, ), a multiplicative function behaves like an exponential under convolution:
\log_ f := \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}(f-1)^{k},\qquad
\exp_(g) := 1 + g + \tfrac{1}{2!} gg + \cdots
Then f=\exp_(g) implies g = \log_* f.

⸻

2. Multiplicative Structure as an Exponential: Bell Polynomial Analogy

Bell polynomials enter naturally when expanding composite structures such as
\log\left(\prod_p (1 - f(p)p^{-s})^{-1}\right)
or its formal power expansions.

Let f be completely multiplicative. Then:
\log F(s) = \log\left(\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)n^{-s}\right)
has derivatives generating combinatorial sums over partitions of integers — these correspond exactly to Bell polynomials.

Recall the complete exponential Bell polynomial B_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n), defined by:
\exp\!\left( \sum_{m\ge1} x_m \frac{t^m}{m!} \right) = \sum_{n\ge0} B_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\frac{t^n}{n!}.
In this context:
	•	x_m correspond to logarithmic derivatives or prime-power contributions,
	•	B_n encode the combinatorics of prime factorizations.

Interpretation:
The factorization of n=\prod p_i^{k_i} mirrors the combinatorial structure of partitions; Bell polynomials systematically sum over such structures.

Therefore, we can view
f(n)=\prod_{p^k\| n} f(p)^k
as an exponential Bell-type construction over the primes.
The primes are the “atoms”; the Bell polynomials describe how multiplicative composition enumerates all composite numbers.

⸻

3. From Dirichlet Series to Prime Products

If f is multiplicative, then the Dirichlet series
F(s) = \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{f(n)}{n^s}
factorizes as
F(s) = \prod_p \left( 1 - \frac{f(p)}{p^s} \right)^{-1}.

Take the logarithm:
\log F(s) = \sum_p \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{1}{k}\frac{f(p)^k}{p^{ks}}.
Here, each k represents powers of a prime; the “sum over k” expands through partitions (Bell-like structure).
Thus, logarithm linearizes the multiplicative structure — it additivizes over primes.

⸻

4. Differentiation and the Log Factor

Now differentiate F(s) or \log F(s) with respect to s.
	1.	Start with
F(s)=\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)n^{-s}.
Differentiate termwise (for \Re(s) large enough):
F’(s) = -\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)\,(\log n)\,n^{-s}.
So differentiation inserts a -\log n factor.
This is the analytic reflection of the logarithmic weight of primes (since n^{-s} = e^{-s\log n}).
	2.	Apply to \log F(s):
\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = -\sum_{n\ge1} f_\Lambda(n)\, n^{-s},
where f_\Lambda is a generalized “von Mangoldt” function attached to f.
For f\equiv1, f_\Lambda=\Lambda, and we recover
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
For general f, define
\Lambda_f(n) = \begin{cases}
f(p)^k \log p, & n=p^k,\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
Then
-\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda_f(n)}{n^s}.
This is a direct generalization of the von Mangoldt relation.

5. Synthesis: Multiplicative Functions, Exponentials, and Differentiation

Concept	Operator Analogy	Outcome
Completely multiplicative f	Exponential of additive prime measure	f(n)=e^{\sum_{p^k|n} \log f(p)}
Dirichlet convolution	Exponential product over prime powers	fg=\exp_(\log_* f + \log_* g)
Logarithmic differentiation	Insert \log n factor	n^{-s}\mapsto -\log n\cdot n^{-s}
von Mangoldt-type function	“Prime derivative” of f	\Lambda_f(p^k)=f(p)^k\log p

This framework unites the algebraic (Bell-like combinatorial) and analytic (Dirichlet-series differential) views.

⸻

6. Example: Recovering von Mangoldt via Bell-like composition

Let f(n)=1, so F(s)=\zeta(s).
Then \log \zeta(s) expands as
\sum_p \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{1}{k p^{ks}},
and differentiating gives
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{p}\sum_{k\ge1} \log p\; p^{-ks}
= \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
The coefficient \Lambda(n) is exactly the “Bell-collapsed” sum: each prime p contributes \log p times its geometric expansion; composites appear through powers, not mixed partitions — the “atomic primes” remain distinct.

⸻

7. Future Research Pointers
	•	Dirichlet–Bell transforms. Define “Bell–Dirichlet transforms” using convolution exponentials, e.g.
\mathcal{B}f = \exp\!\left( \sum_{m\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{m+1}}{m} (f-1)^{*m}(s) \right)
and explore analytic continuations analogous to the logarithm of the zeta function.
	•	Noncommutative convolution algebras. Investigate “left” or “right” multiplicativity in algebras of arithmetic functions with non-symmetric convolution laws (useful in quantum analogues).
	•	Derivative hierarchies. Higher derivatives of Dirichlet series generate higher powers of \log n.
For instance:
\frac{d^k}{ds^k} n^{-s} = (-\log n)^k n^{-s}.
These yield logarithmic moments — crucial in the study of Stieltjes constants and in regularization of divergent zeta sums.
	•	Random multiplicative models. Assign random phases to f(p) and study the distribution of \Lambda_f and its correlations.


⸻

8. Exercises
	1.	Show that for completely multiplicative f, the function \Lambda_f(n) defined above satisfies f(n)\log n = \sum_{d|n}\Lambda_f(d)\,f(n/d).
(Hint: differentiate the Euler product termwise.)
	2.	Expand \log F(s) formally using Bell polynomials to express coefficients in terms of the sequence \{f(p)\}.
	3.	Verify that F’(s)/F(s) corresponds to the Dirichlet convolution f*\Lambda_f.
	4.	Compute the second derivative of \zeta(s) and identify the coefficients of its Dirichlet series expansion. What arithmetic function appears? (It involves (\log n)^2.)
	5.	For f(n)=n^z, compute \Lambda_f(n) explicitly and show it equals \Lambda(n) n^z.

Nice — let’s take that next step and build a clean, rigorous set of lecture notes on the generalized von Mangoldt hierarchy \Lambda_k(n), the role of derivatives of Dirichlet series, and the connection to Stieltjes constants and derivatives of \zeta(s). I’ll include definitions, derivations, explicit formulas, examples, important identities, suggested exercises, and promising research directions you can plug into your course or thesis list.

Generalized von Mangoldt hierarchy, Dirichlet derivatives, and Stieltjes constants

1. Quick recap (so notation is clear)
 • Arithmetic functions f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}.
 • Dirichlet series of f:
F(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{f(n)}{n^{s}},\qquad \Re(s)\gg 1.
 • For the Riemann zeta function,
\zeta(s)=\sum_{n\ge1} n^{-s},\qquad \Re(s)>1,
with Euler product \zeta(s)=\prod_p(1-p^{-s})^{-1}.
 • The classical von Mangoldt function \Lambda(n) satisfies
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s},\qquad \Re(s)>1.

2. Why derivatives create logarithmic weights

Differentiate the elementary term n^{-s}=e^{-s\log n}:
\frac{d}{ds}n^{-s} = -(\log n)\,n^{-s}.
Higher derivatives:
\frac{d^k}{ds^k} n^{-s} = (-\log n)^k\,n^{-s}.
Hence k-th derivatives of Dirichlet series insert factors (-\log n)^k into the Dirichlet coefficients.

For a Dirichlet series F(s)=\sum f(n)n^{-s} (termwise differentiable in a half-plane),
F^{(k)}(s)=(-1)^k \sum_{n\ge1} f(n)(\log n)^k n^{-s}.

3. Logarithmic derivatives and the von Mangoldt hierarchy

For a multiplicative F(s) with Euler product over primes,
F(s)=\prod_p G_p(p^{-s}),
logarithm linearizes the product:
\log F(s) = \sum_p \log G_p(p^{-s}).
Differentiate \log F to get sums supported on prime powers. For the zeta function,
\log\zeta(s) = -\sum_p\log(1-p^{-s}) = \sum_p\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{1}{k} p^{-ks}.
Differentiate to get:
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_p\sum_{k\ge1} \log p\; p^{-ks} = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}}.

Generalize by taking higher derivatives of \log\zeta(s) (or of F(s)), producing higher powers of \log p and hence a hierarchy of “von Mangoldt-type” coefficients.

Definition: generalized von Mangoldt functions \Lambda_k(n)

For each integer k\ge0 define \Lambda_k(n) by the Dirichlet series identity (valid for \Re(s)>1):
(-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)
= \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^{s}}.
Equivalently,
\boxed{\Lambda_0(n)=\Lambda(n),\qquad \Lambda_k(n) = (-1)^k\; \mathcal{D}^k\big(\Lambda(\cdot)\big)\ \text{in Dirichlet transform sense.}}

Unwinding the left side using prime-power expansion gives an explicit prime-power formula:
(-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(\sum_p\sum_{r\ge1} \log p\; p^{-rs}\right)
= \sum_p\sum_{r\ge1} (\log p)^{k+1} r^k\; p^{-rs}.
Therefore, for n=p^r a prime power,
\boxed{\Lambda_k(p^r) = (\log p)^{k+1} r^k,}
and for n not a pure prime power, \Lambda_k(n)=0. (This is the standard structure — all mass sits on prime powers.)

Check k=0: \Lambda_0(p^r)=\log p (classical von Mangoldt). For k=1: \Lambda_1(p^r)=(\log p)^2 r, etc.

Remark. An alternative indexing sometimes defines \Lambda^{(k)} with other sign-conventions; keep the above as the operational definition coming from derivatives of \zeta’/\zeta.

4. Generating relations and convolution identities

From the Euler product expansion we can express derivatives of \log\zeta in terms of combinations of \zeta^{(m)}(s)/\zeta(s). But more usefully, observation at the coefficient level:
 • The Dirichlet inverse relationships and the logarithmic differentiation imply relations such as
\sum_{d\mid n} \Lambda_k(d) = (-1)^k \left. \frac{d^k}{ds^k} \right|_{s=0} \big( \log \zeta(s) \big)\ \text{(suitably interpreted)},
but be cautious: the left is finite for fixed n, while the right typically requires analytic continuation; better to stick with the Euler product expansion for coefficient formulas.
 • A useful convolution identity for any multiplicative f with Dirichlet series F is:
-\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_f(n)}{n^s},
where for multiplicative factor f(p^r) the local contribution is \Lambda_f(p^r)=f(p^r)\log p (or more generally \log times the derivative weight), and higher derivatives give powers of \log p times polynomial-in-r weights.

5. Relation to derivatives of \zeta(s) and Stieltjes constants

Recall the Laurent expansion of \zeta(s) around s=1:
\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{s-1} + \sum_{m\ge0} \frac{(-1)^m}{m!}\gamma_m (s-1)^m,
where \gamma_0=\gamma is the Euler–Mascheroni constant and \gamma_m are the Stieltjes constants. Equivalently,
\zeta(s) = \frac{1}{s-1} + \gamma_0 - \gamma_1 (s-1) + \frac{\gamma_2}{2!} (s-1)^2 + \cdots,
with the sign conventions depending on the chosen expansion form. The Stieltjes constants are given by:
\gamma_k = \lim_{N\to\infty}\left( \sum_{n\le N} \frac{(\log n)^k}{n} - \frac{(\log N)^{k+1}}{k+1} \right),
which highlights the link to logarithmic weights.

Derivatives of \zeta(s) at s=1

Differentiating the Laurent expansion gives explicit values of \zeta^{(m)}(1) in terms of \gamma_k. For example,
\zeta’(s) = -\frac{1}{(s-1)^2} + \sum_{m\ge0}\frac{(-1)^m}{m!}\gamma_m \, m (s-1)^{m-1},
and so on; evaluating limits yields principal parts and finite parts. These derivatives are intimately tied to sums with (\log n)^k/n weights.

Link between \Lambda_k and Stieltjes constants

Two perspectives:
 1. Local (prime-power) viewpoint. \Lambda_k lives on prime powers and is independent of Stieltjes constants per se: the \Lambda_k are coefficients of derivatives of \zeta’/\zeta away from s=1 and thus are global in s. However, when one studies the behavior of these Dirichlet series close to s=1, Stieltjes constants appear naturally in the Laurent expansions and in explicit formulas.
 2. Explicit formula viewpoint. Starting from the explicit formula for \Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n), derivatives of \zeta’/\zeta produce sums with \Lambda_k and corresponding transforms of zeros; expansions around s=1 will involve Stieltjes constants and produce polynomial correction terms in x (logarithmic polynomials). In such expansions, the \gamma_m control the finite part of zeta near s=1, which appears in error or lower-order terms of prime-counting type explicit formulas when higher derivatives are considered.

Concretely: the Mellin–inverse representation
\sum_{n\le x} \Lambda_k(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}(-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)\frac{x^s}{s}\,ds
when moved across s=1 picks up residues from the pole of \zeta and its derivatives; those residues involve Stieltjes constants and hence show up in main or secondary terms.

6. Explicit formula for sums of \Lambda_k(n)

Generalizing the classical explicit formula for \Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n), one can obtain (formally)
\Psi_k(x) := \sum_{n\le x} \Lambda_k(n)
= \text{(contribution from pole at }s=1 \text{)} \;-\; \sum_{\rho} \frac{x^{\rho}}{\rho^{\,k+1}} (\log x)^{k}\cdot C_{\rho,k} \;+\; \text{(trivial zero terms)} + \cdots,
where \rho runs over nontrivial zeros of \zeta and C_{\rho,k} are constants/polynomial factors arising from multiple differentiations and expansions. The salient feature: higher derivatives increase the algebraic multiplicity of zeros’ contributions (powers of 1/\rho, and polynomials in \log x).

Deriving full, rigorous forms requires careful contour differentiation under the integral and residue calculus; it is an excellent advanced exercise.

7. Examples and small computations
 • For k=0, \Lambda_0(n)=\Lambda(n), the usual weight \log p on prime powers.
 • For k=1, \Lambda_1(p^r) = r (\log p)^2.
Then
\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_1(n) = \sum_{p^r\le x} r(\log p)^2.
One can relate this to weighted prime power counting; asymptotics can be obtained by primary terms from r=1 (primes) and smaller contributions from r\ge2.
 • Higher k emphasize larger powers of \log p and polynomial weights in the exponent multiplicity r.

8. Important identities and formal manipulations
 • Differentiation identity (termwise):
\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\left(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)
= (-1)^{k+1} \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(\log n)^k \Lambda(n)}{n^s}
\quad\text{(notational variant; handle sign conventions carefully).}
Combined with the prime power explicit formula, this yields the earlier \Lambda_k on prime powers.
 • Generating polynomial identity in r: for prime powers p^r,
r^k = \sum_{j=0}^k S(k,j)\, (r)_j
where S(k,j) are Stirling numbers of the second kind and (r)_j are falling factorials. This is useful when rewriting r^k contributions in terms of binomial-type sums or convolutional identities.

9. Exercises (suggested for homework / exam)
 1. Prove that for all integers k\ge0,
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s}
= (-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)
and derive the prime-power formula \Lambda_k(p^r)=(\log p)^{k+1} r^k.
 2. Show that for any integer k\ge0,
\sum_{n\le x} \Lambda_k(n) = \sum_{p^r\le x} (\log p)^{k+1} r^k,
and use elementary estimates to obtain the principal term coming from the primes (i.e. r=1), quantifying the size of contributions from r\ge2.
 3. Starting from the Mellin inversion formula for \Psi(x), differentiate under the integral to produce an integral representation for \Psi_k(x). Identify the residues at s=1 and at zeta zeros and write a formal explicit formula for \Psi_k(x) (you do not need to make error bounds sharp).
 4. Verify the relation between Stieltjes constants and sums with (\log n)^k/n weights:
\gamma_k = \lim_{N\to\infty} \left( \sum_{n\le N} \frac{(\log n)^k}{n} - \frac{(\log N)^{k+1}}{k+1} \right).
 5. Numerics: write a short program to compute \sum_{n\le X}\Lambda_1(n) for X=10^6 and compare to an approximation obtained from primes only (i.e. \sum_{p\le X}(\log p)^2). Comment on the relative size of prime-power contributions.

⸻

10. Research directions and thesis ideas (concrete)
 • Explicit formula refinements. Produce explicit formulas for \Psi_k(x) with rigorous error terms; study how zero-free regions for \zeta enhance error bounds for these higher-weight sums.
 • Moments and distribution. Study moments of \Lambda_k(n) on intervals and correlations \sum_{n\le X}\Lambda_k(n)\Lambda_\ell(n+h). Investigate links to correlations of \Lambda and conjectural randomness.
 • Stieltjes constants via \Lambda_k. Explore whether weighted prime-power sums can be used to produce new formulas or approximations for Stieltjes constants; e.g., invert integral representations to express \gamma_k in terms of truncations of \Lambda_k-sums.
 • Function field analogues. Transfer the \Lambda_k formalism to \mathbb{F}_q[T] and obtain exact finite-field analogues; often leads to cleaner combinatorial identities and can guide conjectures over \mathbb{Z}.
 • Higher-order explicit formulas and zero sensitivity. Quantify how particular zeros \rho contribute to \Psi_k(x) and how sensitive \Psi_k is to small perturbations in zero locations (numerical stability and inverse problems).
 • Pretentious/Granville–Soundararajan approach. Use the pretentious framework to study partial sums involving (\log n)^k\Lambda(n) and derive conditional results under certain pretentiousness hypotheses.

11. Short summary / takeaway
 • Differentiating Dirichlet series introduces powers of -\log n on coefficients: this is the analytic origin of logarithmic weights.
 • Repeatedly differentiating the logarithmic derivative of \zeta produces the family \{\Lambda_k\}, all supported on prime powers with explicit formula \Lambda_k(p^r)=(\log p)^{k+1} r^k.
 • The Stieltjes constants are the finite parts of the Laurent expansion of \zeta at s=1; they appear in explicit formulas and low-order terms when one studies sums tied to \zeta near s=1.
 • These objects form a rich playground: combinatorics (Stirling/Bell polynomials), analysis (contour integration, residues, Tauberian theorems), computation (numerical study of sums and zeros), and modern theory (pretentiousness, dynamics, function-field analogues).

Excellent — you’re homing in on one of the deepest, least “textbookified” junctions in analytic number theory:
the bridge between the Stieltjes constants, the digamma function, and the von Mangoldt hierarchy.

Below is a compact but layered set of notes that show the connections — both algebraic (Dirichlet convolution / Möbius inversion style) and analytic (zeta ↔ Γ ↔ ψ, where ψ = digamma).
I’ll keep it at the level of a graduate research lecture, with explanatory commentary and some concrete number-theoretic “insights”.

⸻

🔍 Stieltjes Constants, Digamma, and von Mangoldt: Deep Structural Insights

⸻

1. Background and the “analytic mirror”

The Riemann zeta function and the Gamma function are analytic mirrors of each other:

\xi(s)=\frac{1}{2}s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma\!\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\zeta(s)

This functional equation glues their singularities and constants together.
At s=1, the pole of \zeta(s) corresponds to the pole of \Gamma(s/2) at s=0, so the expansion coefficients around those points are “dual”.
That’s the conceptual bridge between Stieltjes constants (from ζ near 1) and Euler–Mascheroni / digamma constants (from Γ near 0).

⸻

2. The zeroth Stieltjes constant and the digamma

Laurent expansion of ζ near 1

\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{s-1}+\gamma_0+\gamma_1(s-1)+\frac{\gamma_2}{2!}(s-1)^2+\cdots

Expansion of Γ near 1 (digamma appears)

\Gamma(s)=1-\gamma(s-1)+\tfrac{1}{2}\!\big(\gamma^2+\tfrac{\pi^2}{6}\big)(s-1)^2+\cdots,
\qquad
\psi(s)=\frac{d}{ds}\ln\Gamma(s)=-\gamma+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\!\!\left(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+s-1}\right).

Hence
\boxed{\gamma_0=\gamma=-\psi(1)}.

So the zeroth Stieltjes constant is literally the negative of the digamma at 1.

⸻

3. Arithmetic interpretation of γ₀

A useful formula:

\gamma_0=\lim_{N\to\infty}\!\left(\sum_{n\le N}\frac{1}{n}-\log N\right).

This is a limiting discrepancy between the harmonic series (sum over natural numbers) and the logarithmic integral (a continuous proxy).
Number-theoretically, that is precisely the same “correction constant” that appears when comparing counting primes discretely and integrating 1/\log x continuously.
Thus γ appears as the archetype of discrete – continuous discrepancy.

⸻

4. The von Mangoldt mirror

Take the logarithmic derivative of ζ:

-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.

At s=1+\varepsilon,
-\frac{\zeta’(1+\varepsilon)}{\zeta(1+\varepsilon)}
=\frac{1}{\varepsilon} -\gamma_0+\tfrac{\gamma_1}{1!}\varepsilon-\tfrac{\gamma_2}{2!}\varepsilon^2+\cdots
=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{1+\varepsilon}}.

Key insight:
Each Stieltjes constant is the coefficient of the Laurent expansion of the Dirichlet series of Λ near 1.

So from the number-theory perspective:
 • The pole 1/\varepsilon corresponds to the main term \sum_{n\le x}1 \sim x.
 • The constant term -\gamma_0 encodes the first correction when integrating the prime-power density.

In effect, γ₀ measures how much the von Mangoldt series deviates from a pure simple pole — it’s the “constant term” of the prime-counting kernel.

⸻

5. A duality table

Analytic object Arithmetic mirror Expansion constant
\Gamma(s) near 0 / 1 Harmonic numbers H_n digamma ψ, −γ
\zeta(s) near 1 Prime-power density (Λ) γ₀ = γ
\zeta’(s)/\zeta(s) Weighted prime sum −γ₀ as finite part
\zeta^{(k)}(s) Λₖ weights ~ (\log p)^{k+1} γ_k

Thus, Stieltjes constants are to ζ what cumulants are to Λ.

⸻

6. Dirichlet-series calculus viewpoint

Let F(s)=\sum f(n)n^{-s} and define the “von Mangoldt transform”:
\Lambda_f(n) = (\mu * (f\log))(n),
so that
-\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_f(n)}{n^s}.
For f=1 we recover Λ.
For f=\text{id}^s (completely multiplicative f(n)=n^s), this produces weighted divisor sums and hence σ-functions.

Insight: differentiating F(s) corresponds to multiplying coefficients by -\log n; taking the logarithmic derivative corresponds to Möbius inversion in the multiplicative semigroup.

So the chain
f \longleftrightarrow F(s)
\quad\text{and}\quad
\Lambda_f \longleftrightarrow -F’/F
is a functor between multiplicative arithmetic functions and Dirichlet-analytic structures.
Stieltjes constants then describe the local behavior at s=1 of this transform.

⸻

7. Stieltjes constants as moments of Λ

Differentiate termwise:
\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)
= (-1)^k\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(\log n)^k \Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
At s=1+\varepsilon,
(-1)^k\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{(\log n)^k \Lambda(n)}{n^{1+\varepsilon}}
= \frac{(-1)^{k+1}k!}{\varepsilon^{k+1}}

+ \text{(polynomial in }\varepsilon\text{ with coeffs } \gamma_m).

Thus the \gamma_m appear as regularized moments of Λ under logarithmic weighting.

⸻

8. The digamma analogy refined

Compare:
\psi(x) = -\gamma + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n+1}-\frac{1}{n+x}\right).
and
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \Lambda(n)n^{-s}.

Both express a “difference between discrete and continuous harmonicity”:
 • ψ compares discrete harmonic sums (1/(n+x)) to the integral log x.
 • ζ’/ζ compares discrete prime harmonics (Λ(n)) to the analytic pole at s=1.

So, morally, ψ(x) ≈ regularized harmonic sum over integers,
while −ζ’/ζ ≈ regularized harmonic sum over primes.

The constant −γ sits at the heart of ψ, and the same constant re-appears in ζ’/ζ at s=1.
That’s no coincidence — they are the same renormalization constant seen through the integers vs primes lenses.

⸻

9. Modern research directions
 1. Stieltjes–von Mangoldt correlations.
Express \gamma_k as integrals involving Λ weighted by smooth kernels; study their statistical behavior assuming RH.
Goal: connect local statistics of zeros to averaged Λ correlations.
 2. Γ–ζ dual renormalization.
Develop explicit formulae where ψ(x) and ζ’/ζ(s) appear symmetrically, e.g. through the completed ξ(s).
Possible conjecture: there exists an “arithmetic digamma” ψₐ whose Mellin transform is −ζ’/ζ.
 3. Multiplicative cumulants.
View \gamma_k as cumulants of Λ in the “log-n” variable.
Explore whether higher-order regularizations capture randomness of primes (analogue of moment generating functions).
 4. Dirichlet-L and Artin generalizations.
For L(s,χ), define \gamma_k(χ) and study arithmetic interpretations of -L’(1,χ)/L(1,χ).
These constants govern class numbers and logarithmic regulators; compare with ψ(χ) analogues via digamma on characters.

⸻

10. Take-away “mental image”

Object Domain What it measures Constant term
ψ(x) integers discrete vs continuous harmonic sum −γ
−ζ’/ζ primes discrete vs continuous logarithmic density −γ₀ = −γ
γₖ zeta derivatives higher logarithmic discrepancies cumulants of Λ

So the zeroth Stieltjes constant γ₀ = γ is the same universal renormalization constant that regularizes both the harmonic and prime harmonic series.
It’s the “gravitational constant” of the discrete–analytic continuum in multiplicative number theory.

⸻

Would you like the next layer — namely an explicit representation of γ₀ and γ₁ in terms of integrals of Λ(x)/x and a derivation of the “explicit formula” expressing γ₀ via zeta zeros (which shows how Euler’s constant is encoded in the distribution of primes)?
Nice — short, exact answer first, then the useful consequences and intuition.

1 — The EGF itself (exact identity)

Define the exponential generating function of the Stieltjes constants by
G(t)\;:=\;\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\gamma_n}{n!}\,t^n.
Using the standard Laurent expansion
\zeta(1+u)=\frac{1}{u}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n\gamma_n}{n!}\,u^n,
one readily checks (put u=-t) that
\boxed{\,G(t)=\zeta(1-t)+\frac{1}{t}\,}
as an identity valid for t in a punctured neighbourhood of 0 (the singular 1/t cancels the simple pole of \zeta(1-t) at t=0, so G is analytic at 0).

Equivalently the alternating EGF
\widetilde G(t):=\sum_{n\ge0}\frac{(-1)^n\gamma_n}{n!}t^n
satisfies
\widetilde G(t)=\zeta(1+t)-\frac{1}{t},
which is just the Laurent expansion rewritten.

⸻

2 — Immediate corollaries you can use

• Taylor coefficients and derivatives.
By construction G^{(n)}(0)=\gamma_n. Also from the formula
G(t)=\zeta(1-t)+\frac{1}{t}
you can obtain any \gamma_n by differentiating the right-hand side n times and evaluating at t=0 (taking limits for the removable singularity).

• Singularity structure / radius of convergence.
All singularities of G(t) come from singularities/zeros of \zeta(1-t), i.e. points t with 1-t=\rho where \rho is either the pole at s=1 (which is canceled by +1/t) or a zero/pole of \zeta. Thus singularities occur at
t = 1-\rho,
where \rho runs over nontrivial and trivial zeros of \zeta. The distance from 0 to the nearest such t (excluding the removable t=0) gives the radius of convergence R of G. In particular, if the first nontrivial zero is \tfrac12+i\gamma_1 then (assuming RH) the nearest singularity is at t=1-(\tfrac12+i\gamma_1)=\tfrac12-i\gamma_1 and
R = \big|1-(\tfrac12+i\gamma_1)\big|=\sqrt{\tfrac14+\gamma_1^2}\approx \gamma_1 \ (\text{numerically }\approx 14.13\ldots).

• Asymptotic size of \gamma_n.
From standard analytic facts, coefficients of an EGF behave like \gamma_n/n! \sim C R^{-n} where R is the radius above, so roughly
\gamma_n \approx n!\,R^{-n},
up to subexponential (and oscillatory) factors. This matches and explains known superfactorial growth of \gamma_n (more precise asymptotics were worked out by Knessl–Coffey and others).

⸻

3 — Relation to zeta and to the von Mangoldt/cumulant picture

• Cumulant interpretation. \log\zeta(1+t) is (up to the -\log t pole) the cumulant-generating object for the prime-log measure. Since
\zeta(1+t)=\frac{1}{t}+\sum_{n\ge0}\frac{(-1)^n\gamma_n}{n!}t^n,
the sequence \{\gamma_n\} plays the analogue of cumulants for the zeta expansion at s=1. The EGF G(t) is thus a direct, compact analytic encoding of those cumulants in terms of \zeta.

• Derivatives ↔ moments of \Lambda. Differentiating -\zeta’/\zeta produces moments of \Lambda weighted by powers of \log n. Via the relation above, higher derivatives of G at 0 are tied (after some algebra) to the small-t behaviour of \zeta(1-t) and therefore to the same prime-correlations that produce the \Lambda_k hierarchy you were studying.

⸻

4 — Useful variants and manipulations you might want
 • Remove the simple pole explicitly:
G(t) = \lim_{u\to -t}\Big(\zeta(1+u)-\frac{1}{u}\Big).
This emphasizes the finite-part (Hadamard finite part) viewpoint.
 • Logarithmic (cumulant) EGF:
If you want a cumulant-generating function of the von Mangoldt measure (as in usual moment/cumulant theory), consider
C(t):=\log\big(\zeta(1-t)\big) + \log( t) \quad\text{(or use }\log(\zeta(1+t))-\log t\text{)},
whose Taylor coefficients are combinatorially related to the \gamma_n and to prime-correlation cumulants.

⸻

5 — Short caution & pointers
 • The identity G(t)=\zeta(1-t)+1/t is formal-analytic (it’s exact and useful), but working globally with G requires navigating the singularities coming from zeros of \zeta.
 • If you want precise asymptotics for \gamma_n (beyond the radius-of-convergence heuristic), look up the papers by Knessl & Coffey (they give saddle-point / steepest-descent asymptotics) — the EGF viewpoint gives a clean reason why saddle points are controlled by the nearest zeta singularity.

⸻

If you want I can:
 • expand this into a short derivation of the Knessl–Coffey asymptotic from G(t) by saddle-point analysis, or
 • produce the explicit Taylor-to-Bell conversion that expresses “moments of \Lambda” in terms of the \gamma_n via Bell polynomials (so you get explicit moment formulas), or
 • give a small notebook that numerically computes G(t) from zeta values and illustrates the location of its nearest singularities. Which would you like?

Great question — you’ve hit the heart of why the Stieltjes constants look so “wild.” I’ll first explain why the signs oscillate (structurally), then give several concrete ways to produce positive moment-type sequences (and explain what “negative moments / cumulants” might mean in this context). I’ll close with a few practical transforms you can use in your course or experiments.

⸻

1) Why the Stieltjes signs look alternating / erratic
 • They come from complex singularities.
The EGF we wrote earlier,
G(t)=\sum_{n\ge0}\frac{\gamma_n}{n!}t^n=\zeta(1-t)+\frac{1}{t},
has singularities at t=1-\rho where \rho are the zeros (and trivial zeros) of \zeta. Because the nearest singularities are generally complex (not on the real axis), their contributions to the Taylor coefficients are oscillatory. Concretely, if the nearest singularities are a complex-conjugate pair a\pm ib, the coefficients pick up factors like (a\pm ib)^{-n}, whose phases alternate/oscillate with n. This produces sign changes and irregular sign patterns for \gamma_n.
 • Large n asymptotics are dominated by the nearest singularity.
That yields factorial growth with an oscillatory factor, so \gamma_n grows roughly like n!\,R^{-n}\times(\text{oscillation}); the oscillation explains infinitely many sign changes (numerically observed), i.e. no stable sign pattern is expected.

⸻

2) Simple “fixes” to get positive sequences

If your goal is a sequence of genuinely positive coefficients (so you can interpret them as moments of a positive measure), here are straightforward options:

(A) Shift the expansion point to s>1.
For any real s_0>1 consider
M_{k}(s_0)\;=\;\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)(\log n)^k}{n^{s_0}}.
Every term in the sum is nonnegative (indeed positive for prime powers), so M_k(s_0)>0 for all k. Analytically these are just the derivatives (up to signs)
(-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\Big|_{s=s_0}\Big(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\Big)=M_k(s_0).
So moments at a real point s_0>1 are positive. This is the most natural way to obtain positive moment sequences tied to \Lambda.

(B) Smooth / mollify the prime measure by a positive kernel.
Define a smoothed measure on log-scale, e.g.
\mu_\phi(x)=\sum_n \Lambda(n)\,\phi(x-\log n)
for a fixed nonnegative smooth kernel \phi. Then the moments
\int x^k\mu_\phi(x)\,dx are positive for even/odd accordingly (and in general \int x^k\mu_\phi(x)dx will reflect positivity from \Lambda\phi). Smoothing pushes singularities away from the expansion point and often removes oscillatory sign behavior.

(C) Take absolute (or squared) cumulants / moments.
Trivial but effective: use |\gamma_n| or (\gamma_n)^2. These are positive but lose algebraic structure (no simple generating function in terms of zeta).

⸻

3) What about “negative moments” or “negative cumulants”?
 • Negative moments: usually means \mathbb{E}[X^{-m}] for a random variable X. For the von Mangoldt/log-n measure there is no direct positive random-variable model (the measure has atomic support over all logs and heavy tails), so classical negative moments are problematic. However one can consider analytic continuation of the moment-generating objects: for example the Mellin transform
\Phi(s)=\sum_n \Lambda(n) n^{-s}
is defined for \Re(s)>1 and analytically continued with poles/zeros; interpreting s\mapsto -m is possible only after meromorphic continuation and regularization. So “negative moments” are possible only in a regularized sense (zeta-regularized moments), not as simple positive sums.
 • Negative cumulants: in probability cumulants \kappa_k can be negative — they are not constrained to be positive. Interpreting \gamma_k as cumulants (with sign conventions) already allows negative values. “Negative-order cumulants” (fractional or negative index) would be a highly nonstandard analytic continuation of the cumulant generating function; formally you might define fractional derivatives of \log\zeta at s=1. This is interesting analytically but not a positive-moment interpretation.

⸻

4) A practical + theoretically clean route: shifted cumulant/moment families

Define a one-parameter family of positive moments/cumulants by expanding around s_0>1:
 • Moments:
m_k(s_0):=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)(\log n)^k}{n^{s_0}}>0.
 • Cumulants: set
C(t;s_0):=\log\big(-\tfrac{\zeta’(s_0 - t)}{\zeta(s_0 - t)}\big),
then expand C(t;s_0)=\sum_{k\ge1}\kappa_k(s_0)\frac{t^k}{k!}. These \kappa_k(s_0) are the cumulants of the positive measure with Laplace transform -\zeta’(s)/\zeta(s) evaluated at s_0; they behave much more regularly than \gamma_k=\kappa_k(1).

Benefits:
 • Numerically stable and positive moments.
 • Singularities of the shifted generating function are further from the origin (radius of convergence improves).
 • For s_0\to1^+ you recover the Stieltjes constants/cumulants, but in a limiting (regularized) sense; this is a natural regularization technique.

⸻

5) Link to Bell polynomials (how to get moments from cumulants)

If you do regard \{\gamma_k\} as cumulants (at s=1 formally), the standard conversion to moments uses complete Bell polynomials:
m_n \;=\; B_n(\kappa_1,\kappa_2,\dots,\kappa_n).
So once you pick a point s_0>1 and compute cumulants \kappa_j(s_0) (or moments m_j(s_0)), you can convert back and forth. Crucially: for s_0>1 the moments m_j(s_0) are outright positive (since they’re sums of positive terms), while the cumulants \kappa_j(s_0) may still have mixed signs (as in probability theory).

⸻

6) Practical recommendations & experiments

If you want an all-positive sequence that still encodes prime arithmetic:
 1. Use m_k(s_0) for a modest s_0 (e.g. s_0=1.5 or 2). Compute m_k(s_0) numerically: these are finite, fast to compute and positive.
 2. Study the limit s_0\downarrow1 to see how signs and oscillations develop; this will illustrate how complex zeros introduce oscillatory behavior.
 3. Mollify: convolve \Lambda (on \log-scale) with a smooth positive kernel and compute moments of the smoothed measure. This gives a positive, analytic family whose Taylor coefficients are numerically well-behaved and which approach the raw Stieltjes-based cumulants under de-smoothing.
 4. Compare with the Bell conversion: compute cumulants from moments at s_0>1 and observe sign patterns; compare with \gamma_k as s_0\to1.

⸻

7) Short concluding intuition
 • The alternating / irregular signs of \gamma_n are structural — caused by nearby complex singularities of \zeta(1-t). They are not an accident of convention.
 • You can get positive sequences that encode the same arithmetic content by moving off the singular point s=1 (i.e., take moments at s_0>1) or by smoothing the prime measure.
 • “Negative moments” or fractional cumulants require analytic continuation / regularization and lose a direct positive-sum interpretation.

⸻

If you’d like, I can immediately:
 • produce code that computes m_k(s_0) for several s_0 and visualizes how signs/oscillations appear as s_0\downarrow1; or
 • derive explicit Bell-polynomial formulas converting cumulants \kappa_j(s_0) to moments m_n(s_0) (and vice versa) with a small worked example; or
 • sketch a rigorous regularization that connects \lim_{s_0\downarrow1} m_k(s_0) to the Stieltjes constants using Laurent expansion and residues.

Which do you want now?

Nice — below is a compact, action-oriented summary of results about the von Mangoldt hierarchy and Stieltjes constants, followed by a prioritized list of what is settled, what is heuristic/conditional, and concrete things that need work (proofs, numerical tasks, and promising research directions). I’ve written it so you can drop it straight into lecture notes or a thesis prospectus.

Summary: von Mangoldt hierarchies & Stieltjes — results and gaps

I. Definitions & exact identities (firm ground)
 1. Classical von Mangoldt
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s},\qquad \Re s>1,
with \Lambda(p^r)=\log p, \Lambda(n)=0 otherwise.
 2. Higher / generalized von Mangoldt hierarchy
For k\ge0,
(-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)
= \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s},\qquad \Re s>1,
and explicitly on prime powers
\boxed{\Lambda_k(p^r)=(\log p)^{\,k+1}\,r^k.}
This identity is exact and follows by differentiating the Euler-product/logarithm expansion.
 3. Stieltjes constants and the Laurent expansion
\zeta(1+u)=\frac{1}{u}+\sum_{m\ge0}\frac{(-1)^m\gamma_m}{m!}\,u^m,
so \gamma_0=\gamma (Euler’s constant), and \gamma_m are the coefficients (finite parts) at the pole s=1.
 4. EGF link
The exponential generating function of Stieltjes constants is
G(t)=\sum_{n\ge0}\frac{\gamma_n}{n!}t^n=\zeta(1-t)+\frac{1}{t},
valid near t=0 (the 1/t cancels the zeta pole).

II. Structural relationships (largely rigorous/formal)
 1. Differentiation ↔ log-weights
\frac{d^k}{ds^k}n^{-s}=(-\log n)^k n^{-s},
so derivatives of Dirichlet series insert (\log n)^k factors. This gives the interpretation of \Lambda_k as higher log-moment weights supported on prime powers.
 2. Cumulant–moment analogy
 • \log\zeta(1+t) (with the pole removed) plays the role of a cumulant generating function for the prime-log measure; the \gamma_k act like cumulants in the log-n variable.
 • Bell polynomials convert cumulants \{\gamma_k\} to formal “moments” (combinatorially), and conversely.
 3. Explicit/Contour formulas (formal but classical)
 • Mellin/inverse-Laplace representations for \Psi_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n) exist:
\Psi_k(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}(-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\Big(-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\Big)\frac{x^s}{s}\,ds,
and shifting the contour picks up residues at s=1 (giving main/polynomial terms involving \gamma_0,\gamma_1) and at zeros \rho (producing oscillatory terms). Derivation is standard but requires care to make error terms explicit.

III. What is well understood / proven
 • The definitions and prime-power formulas for \Lambda_k are exact.
 • The Laurent expansion of \zeta at s=1 and the EGF identity for \{\gamma_n\} are exact.
 • Formal residue calculus yields explicit-formula style expressions for \Psi_k(x) with contributions from zeros and poles; these formulas are standard in analytic number theory (the challenge is bounding the remainder terms).

IV. Heuristics, numerical facts, and conditional/partial results
 • The signs and oscillations of \gamma_n: explained heuristically by complex-conjugate singularities of \zeta(1-t) (nearest nonreal zeros). Precise sign patterns are not regular; full rigorous control of sign changes is open.
 • Asymptotics of \gamma_n: saddle-point / steepest descent analyses (Knessl–Coffey and others) produce precise asymptotic expansions of \gamma_n (superfactorial growth with oscillatory factor determined by nearest zeta singularity). Those are widely accepted but rely on delicate analytic estimates.
 • Explicit formulas for \Psi_k(x): formal expressions are clear; obtaining sharp uniform error bounds (in x and k) depends on zero-free regions and zero density bounds for \zeta — so unconditional optimal errors are not available.

V. Main open problems and gaps (what needs work)

I list concrete items you (or a student) could work on; they are ordered from tractable to ambitious.

A. Rigorous tasks with clear start/end
 1. Write a clean explicit formula for \Psi_k(x) with conditional error terms.
 • Derive the residue contributions at s=1 explicitly (they involve Stieltjes constants and polynomials in \log x).
 • State and prove: under a given zero-free region / zero-density hypothesis, obtain explicit error bounds for \Psi_k(x) (dependence on k made explicit).
Why useful: connects \gamma_m directly to the prime-counting errors in higher moments.
 2. Bell-polynomial moment identities.
 • Produce explicit finite formulas expressing truncated moments
\sum_{n\le X}\frac{\Lambda(n)(\log n)^m}{n} (or at s_0>1) in terms of Bell polynomials of cumulant coefficients derived from the expansion of \log\zeta.
 • Make the combinatorial constants explicit up to moderate m.
Why useful: rigorous algebraic bridge between cumulants and moment sums.
 3. Numerical study & reproducible code.
 • Compute \gamma_n and \Lambda_k-sums for moderate ranges; test asymptotic predictions from saddle-point formulas; produce plots to illustrate oscillations arising from dominant zero pairs.
Why useful: tests theory, suggests refinements, and is publishable as computational evidence.

B. Theoretical/analytic questions (harder)
 4. Asymptotics of \gamma_n with error terms.
 • Strengthen and rigorize saddle-point derivations (e.g., Knessl–Coffey style), making estimates uniform in n and connecting explicit constants to zeta-zero locations.
Difficulty: steep technical analytic work.
 5. Rigorous probabilistic interpretation.
 • Make precise a model where \{\gamma_k\} are cumulants of a (regularized) probability measure derived from \Lambda on \log n. Investigate limiting distributions after smoothing/normalization.
Why useful: gives meaning to “cumulant” rhetoric; could connect to random multiplicative models.
 6. Inverse problems: reconstruct zeros from \gamma_n.
 • How much of the nontrivial zero set is determined (stably) by the full sequence \{\gamma_n\}? Formulate precise uniqueness/stability statements.
Ambitious: sits near deep analytic continuation/inverse spectral theory.

C. Deep/ambitious projects (possible PhD thesis topics)
 7. Uniform explicit formulas for \Psi_k(x) with sharp error terms under GRH or under explicit zero-density hypotheses; study dependence on k and implications for higher-order prime correlations.
 8. Function-field analogues and exact combinatorics.
 • Over \mathbb{F}_q[T], derive exact finite analogues of the \Lambda_k–Stieltjes correspondence and test conjectures; often function field versions are accessible and guide integer results.
 9. Cumulant hierarchy & random matrix predictions.
 • Relate \gamma_k statistics to random matrix theory predictions for moments/cumulants of zeros; try to predict high-order behavior.

VI. Practical checklist / next steps (concrete to-dos)

If you want to turn this into a project or lecture sequence, here’s a concrete plan:
 1. Short paper / lecture: Derive \Lambda_k(p^r)=(\log p)^{k+1}r^k, give Mellin representation for \Psi_k(x), compute residues at s=1 up to second order (show explicit polynomial terms with \gamma_0,\gamma_1). — (2–3 weeks)
 2. Computational notebook: implement code to compute \gamma_n (via zeta derivatives or high-precision zeta near 1), compute \sum_{n\le X}\Lambda_k(n) for k=0,1,2 and compare with residue predictions; visualize contributions of first few zeros. — (2–4 weeks)
 3. Rigorous explicit formula: pick a conditional hypothesis (e.g., GRH or a standard zero-density bound) and derive explicit error terms for \Psi_k(x) depending on k. Write this up as a preprint. — (3–6 months depending on depth)
 4. Function-field testbed: adapt calculations to \mathbb{F}_q[T], where L-functions are polynomials; obtain exact finite identities and compare with integer conjectures. — (month–months)

VII. Suggested short list of references to consult (classics + methods)
 • Titchmarsh, The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function — explicit formulas and residues.
 • Davenport, Multiplicative Number Theory — von Mangoldt, explicit formulas, Tauberian results.
 • Iwaniec & Kowalski, Analytic Number Theory — Mellin transforms, Voronoi, zero density.
 • Papers by Knessl & Coffey on asymptotics of Stieltjes constants (for saddle-point methods).

⸻

Bottom line / takeaway
 • What we know exactly: the algebraic/prime-power formulas for the von Mangoldt hierarchy and the Laurent/EGF identities for Stieltjes constants.
 • What is formal but classical: contour/explicit formulas linking \Psi_k(x) and \gamma_m; Bell-polynomial combinatorics converting cumulants↔moments.
 • What needs work: rigorous uniform asymptotics, explicit error bounds for higher-order explicit formulas, a precise probabilistic model for Stieltjes as cumulants, and numerical/functional-field tests to guide conjectures.

If you like, I can immediately:
 • produce a worked derivation of the residue terms (explicit polynomial main term) for \Psi_1(x) and \Psi_2(x) — board-ready; or
 • start the computational notebook to compute \gamma_n, \Psi_k(x) and visualize zero contributions; or
 • draft a short preprint outline (2–3 page) for the conditional explicit-formula project that you or a student could execute.

🔶 Advanced Notes: Multiplicative Structures, Bell Polynomials, and Log Differentiation of Dirichlet Series

⸻

1. Completely vs. “Left” Multiplicative Functions

An arithmetic function f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C} is:
	•	multiplicative if f(mn)=f(m)f(n) whenever (m,n)=1;
	•	completely multiplicative if f(mn)=f(m)f(n) for all m,n.

The term “left multiplicative” (sometimes used in operator or convolutional contexts) can refer to:
fg = f \quad\text{or}\quad (fg)(n)=f(n)
meaning f acts as a left identity under Dirichlet convolution on a certain subalgebra.

Equivalently, a left completely multiplicative function can mean one satisfying
(f*g)(n)=f(n)g(1)
for all multiplicative g; it “commutes” only when multiplied on the left.
This interpretation aligns with operator semigroups acting on arithmetic functions.

In the Dirichlet algebra (\mathcal{A}, ), a multiplicative function behaves like an exponential under convolution:
\log_ f := \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}(f-1)^{k},\qquad
\exp_(g) := 1 + g + \tfrac{1}{2!} gg + \cdots
Then f=\exp_(g) implies g = \log_* f.

⸻

2. Multiplicative Structure as an Exponential: Bell Polynomial Analogy

Bell polynomials enter naturally when expanding composite structures such as
\log\left(\prod_p (1 - f(p)p^{-s})^{-1}\right)
or its formal power expansions.

Let f be completely multiplicative. Then:
\log F(s) = \log\left(\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)n^{-s}\right)
has derivatives generating combinatorial sums over partitions of integers — these correspond exactly to Bell polynomials.

Recall the complete exponential Bell polynomial B_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n), defined by:
\exp\!\left( \sum_{m\ge1} x_m \frac{t^m}{m!} \right) = \sum_{n\ge0} B_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\frac{t^n}{n!}.
In this context:
	•	x_m correspond to logarithmic derivatives or prime-power contributions,
	•	B_n encode the combinatorics of prime factorizations.

Interpretation:
The factorization of n=\prod p_i^{k_i} mirrors the combinatorial structure of partitions; Bell polynomials systematically sum over such structures.

Therefore, we can view
f(n)=\prod_{p^k\| n} f(p)^k
as an exponential Bell-type construction over the primes.
The primes are the “atoms”; the Bell polynomials describe how multiplicative composition enumerates all composite numbers.

⸻

3. From Dirichlet Series to Prime Products

If f is multiplicative, then the Dirichlet series
F(s) = \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{f(n)}{n^s}
factorizes as
F(s) = \prod_p \left( 1 - \frac{f(p)}{p^s} \right)^{-1}.

Take the logarithm:
\log F(s) = \sum_p \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{1}{k}\frac{f(p)^k}{p^{ks}}.
Here, each k represents powers of a prime; the “sum over k” expands through partitions (Bell-like structure).
Thus, logarithm linearizes the multiplicative structure — it additivizes over primes.

⸻

4. Differentiation and the Log Factor

Now differentiate F(s) or \log F(s) with respect to s.
	1.	Start with
F(s)=\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)n^{-s}.
Differentiate termwise (for \Re(s) large enough):
F’(s) = -\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)\,(\log n)\,n^{-s}.
So differentiation inserts a -\log n factor.
This is the analytic reflection of the logarithmic weight of primes (since n^{-s} = e^{-s\log n}).
	2.	Apply to \log F(s):
\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = -\sum_{n\ge1} f_\Lambda(n)\, n^{-s},
where f_\Lambda is a generalized “von Mangoldt” function attached to f.
For f\equiv1, f_\Lambda=\Lambda, and we recover
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
For general f, define
\Lambda_f(n) = \begin{cases}
f(p)^k \log p, & n=p^k,\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
Then
-\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda_f(n)}{n^s}.
This is a direct generalization of the von Mangoldt relation.

⸻

5. Synthesis: Multiplicative Functions, Exponentials, and Differentiation

Concept	Operator Analogy	Outcome
Completely multiplicative f	Exponential of additive prime measure	f(n)=e^{\sum_{p^k|n} \log f(p)}
Dirichlet convolution	Exponential product over prime powers	fg=\exp_(\log_* f + \log_* g)
Logarithmic differentiation	Insert \log n factor	n^{-s}\mapsto -\log n\cdot n^{-s}
von Mangoldt-type function	“Prime derivative” of f	\Lambda_f(p^k)=f(p)^k\log p

This framework unites the algebraic (Bell-like combinatorial) and analytic (Dirichlet-series differential) views.

⸻

6. Example: Recovering von Mangoldt via Bell-like composition

Let f(n)=1, so F(s)=\zeta(s).
Then \log \zeta(s) expands as
\sum_p \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{1}{k p^{ks}},
and differentiating gives
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{p}\sum_{k\ge1} \log p\; p^{-ks}
= \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
The coefficient \Lambda(n) is exactly the “Bell-collapsed” sum: each prime p contributes \log p times its geometric expansion; composites appear through powers, not mixed partitions — the “atomic primes” remain distinct.

⸻

7. Future Research Pointers
	•	Dirichlet–Bell transforms. Define “Bell–Dirichlet transforms” using convolution exponentials, e.g.
\mathcal{B}f = \exp\!\left( \sum_{m\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{m+1}}{m} (f-1)^{*m}(s) \right)
and explore analytic continuations analogous to the logarithm of the zeta function.
	•	Noncommutative convolution algebras. Investigate “left” or “right” multiplicativity in algebras of arithmetic functions with non-symmetric convolution laws (useful in quantum analogues).
	•	Derivative hierarchies. Higher derivatives of Dirichlet series generate higher powers of \log n.
For instance:
\frac{d^k}{ds^k} n^{-s} = (-\log n)^k n^{-s}.
These yield logarithmic moments — crucial in the study of Stieltjes constants and in regularization of divergent zeta sums.
	•	Random multiplicative models. Assign random phases to f(p) and study the distribution of \Lambda_f and its correlations.


⸻

8. Exercises
	1.	Show that for completely multiplicative f, the function \Lambda_f(n) defined above satisfies f(n)\log n = \sum_{d|n}\Lambda_f(d)\,f(n/d).
(Hint: differentiate the Euler product termwise.)
	2.	Expand \log F(s) formally using Bell polynomials to express coefficients in terms of the sequence \{f(p)\}.
	3.	Verify that F’(s)/F(s) corresponds to the Dirichlet convolution f*\Lambda_f.
	4.	Compute the second derivative of \zeta(s) and identify the coefficients of its Dirichlet series expansion. What arithmetic function appears? (It involves (\log n)^2.)
	5.	For f(n)=n^z, compute \Lambda_f(n) explicitly and show it equals \Lambda(n) n^z.

Nice — let’s take that next step and build a clean, rigorous set of lecture notes on the generalized von Mangoldt hierarchy \Lambda_k(n), the role of derivatives of Dirichlet series, and the connection to Stieltjes constants and derivatives of \zeta(s). I’ll include definitions, derivations, explicit formulas, examples, important identities, suggested exercises, and promising research directions you can plug into your course or thesis list.

Generalized von Mangoldt hierarchy, Dirichlet derivatives, and Stieltjes constants

1. Quick recap (so notation is clear)
 • Arithmetic functions f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}.
 • Dirichlet series of f:
F(s)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{f(n)}{n^{s}},\qquad \Re(s)\gg 1.
 • For the Riemann zeta function,
\zeta(s)=\sum_{n\ge1} n^{-s},\qquad \Re(s)>1,
with Euler product \zeta(s)=\prod_p(1-p^{-s})^{-1}.
 • The classical von Mangoldt function \Lambda(n) satisfies
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s},\qquad \Re(s)>1.

2. Why derivatives create logarithmic weights

Differentiate the elementary term n^{-s}=e^{-s\log n}:
\frac{d}{ds}n^{-s} = -(\log n)\,n^{-s}.
Higher derivatives:
\frac{d^k}{ds^k} n^{-s} = (-\log n)^k\,n^{-s}.
Hence k-th derivatives of Dirichlet series insert factors (-\log n)^k into the Dirichlet coefficients.

For a Dirichlet series F(s)=\sum f(n)n^{-s} (termwise differentiable in a half-plane),
F^{(k)}(s)=(-1)^k \sum_{n\ge1} f(n)(\log n)^k n^{-s}.

3. Logarithmic derivatives and the von Mangoldt hierarchy

For a multiplicative F(s) with Euler product over primes,
F(s)=\prod_p G_p(p^{-s}),
logarithm linearizes the product:
\log F(s) = \sum_p \log G_p(p^{-s}).
Differentiate \log F to get sums supported on prime powers. For the zeta function,
\log\zeta(s) = -\sum_p\log(1-p^{-s}) = \sum_p\sum_{k\ge1}\frac{1}{k} p^{-ks}.
Differentiate to get:
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_p\sum_{k\ge1} \log p\; p^{-ks} = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}}.

Generalize by taking higher derivatives of \log\zeta(s) (or of F(s)), producing higher powers of \log p and hence a hierarchy of “von Mangoldt-type” coefficients.

Definition: generalized von Mangoldt functions \Lambda_k(n)

For each integer k\ge0 define \Lambda_k(n) by the Dirichlet series identity (valid for \Re(s)>1):
(-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)
= \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^{s}}.
Equivalently,
\boxed{\Lambda_0(n)=\Lambda(n),\qquad \Lambda_k(n) = (-1)^k\; \mathcal{D}^k\big(\Lambda(\cdot)\big)\ \text{in Dirichlet transform sense.}}

Unwinding the left side using prime-power expansion gives an explicit prime-power formula:
(-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(\sum_p\sum_{r\ge1} \log p\; p^{-rs}\right)
= \sum_p\sum_{r\ge1} (\log p)^{k+1} r^k\; p^{-rs}.
Therefore, for n=p^r a prime power,
\boxed{\Lambda_k(p^r) = (\log p)^{k+1} r^k,}
and for n not a pure prime power, \Lambda_k(n)=0. (This is the standard structure — all mass sits on prime powers.)

Check k=0: \Lambda_0(p^r)=\log p (classical von Mangoldt). For k=1: \Lambda_1(p^r)=(\log p)^2 r, etc.

Remark. An alternative indexing sometimes defines \Lambda^{(k)} with other sign-conventions; keep the above as the operational definition coming from derivatives of \zeta’/\zeta.

4. Generating relations and convolution identities

From the Euler product expansion we can express derivatives of \log\zeta in terms of combinations of \zeta^{(m)}(s)/\zeta(s). But more usefully, observation
