These notes can be slotted into your existing Lambert-series course, roughly around Week 5–6, as a bridge between the algebra of multiplicative functions and the analytic behavior of Dirichlet series.

🔶 Advanced Notes: Multiplicative Structures, Bell Polynomials, and Log Differentiation of Dirichlet Series

⸻

1. Completely vs. “Left” Multiplicative Functions

An arithmetic function f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C} is:
	•	multiplicative if f(mn)=f(m)f(n) whenever (m,n)=1;
	•	completely multiplicative if f(mn)=f(m)f(n) for all m,n.

The term “left multiplicative” (sometimes used in operator or convolutional contexts) can refer to:
fg = f \quad\text{or}\quad (fg)(n)=f(n)
meaning f acts as a left identity under Dirichlet convolution on a certain subalgebra.

Equivalently, a left completely multiplicative function can mean one satisfying
(f*g)(n)=f(n)g(1)
for all multiplicative g; it “commutes” only when multiplied on the left.
This interpretation aligns with operator semigroups acting on arithmetic functions.

In the Dirichlet algebra (\mathcal{A}, ), a multiplicative function behaves like an exponential under convolution:
\log_ f := \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k}(f-1)^{k},\qquad
\exp_(g) := 1 + g + \tfrac{1}{2!} gg + \cdots
Then f=\exp_(g) implies g = \log_* f.

2. Multiplicative Structure as an Exponential: Bell Polynomial Analogy

Bell polynomials enter naturally when expanding composite structures such as
\log\left(\prod_p (1 - f(p)p^{-s})^{-1}\right)
or its formal power expansions.

Let f be completely multiplicative. Then:
\log F(s) = \log\left(\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)n^{-s}\right)
has derivatives generating combinatorial sums over partitions of integers — these correspond exactly to Bell polynomials.

Recall the complete exponential Bell polynomial B_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n), defined by:
\exp\!\left( \sum_{m\ge1} x_m \frac{t^m}{m!} \right) = \sum_{n\ge0} B_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\frac{t^n}{n!}.
In this context:
	•	x_m correspond to logarithmic derivatives or prime-power contributions,
	•	B_n encode the combinatorics of prime factorizations.

Interpretation:
The factorization of n=\prod p_i^{k_i} mirrors the combinatorial structure of partitions; Bell polynomials systematically sum over such structures.

Therefore, we can view
f(n)=\prod_{p^k\| n} f(p)^k
as an exponential Bell-type construction over the primes.
The primes are the “atoms”; the Bell polynomials describe how multiplicative composition enumerates all composite numbers.

3. From Dirichlet Series to Prime Products

If f is multiplicative, then the Dirichlet series
F(s) = \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{f(n)}{n^s}
factorizes as
F(s) = \prod_p \left( 1 - \frac{f(p)}{p^s} \right)^{-1}.

Take the logarithm:
\log F(s) = \sum_p \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{1}{k}\frac{f(p)^k}{p^{ks}}.
Here, each k represents powers of a prime; the “sum over k” expands through partitions (Bell-like structure).
Thus, logarithm linearizes the multiplicative structure — it additivizes over primes.

4. Differentiation and the Log Factor

Now differentiate F(s) or \log F(s) with respect to s.
	1.	Start with
F(s)=\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)n^{-s}.
Differentiate termwise (for \Re(s) large enough):
F’(s) = -\sum_{n\ge1} f(n)\,(\log n)\,n^{-s}.
So differentiation inserts a -\log n factor.
This is the analytic reflection of the logarithmic weight of primes (since n^{-s} = e^{-s\log n}).
	2.	Apply to \log F(s):
\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = -\sum_{n\ge1} f_\Lambda(n)\, n^{-s},
where f_\Lambda is a generalized “von Mangoldt” function attached to f.
For f\equiv1, f_\Lambda=\Lambda, and we recover
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
For general f, define
\Lambda_f(n) = \begin{cases}
f(p)^k \log p, & n=p^k,\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
Then
-\frac{F’(s)}{F(s)} = \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda_f(n)}{n^s}.
This is a direct generalization of the von Mangoldt relation.

5. Synthesis: Multiplicative Functions, Exponentials, and Differentiation

Concept	Operator Analogy	Outcome
Completely multiplicative f	Exponential of additive prime measure	f(n)=e^{\sum_{p^k|n} \log f(p)}
Dirichlet convolution	Exponential product over prime powers	fg=\exp_(\log_* f + \log_* g)
Logarithmic differentiation	Insert \log n factor	n^{-s}\mapsto -\log n\cdot n^{-s}
von Mangoldt-type function	“Prime derivative” of f	\Lambda_f(p^k)=f(p)^k\log p

This framework unites the algebraic (Bell-like combinatorial) and analytic (Dirichlet-series differential) views.

6. Example: Recovering von Mangoldt via Bell-like composition

Let f(n)=1, so F(s)=\zeta(s).
Then \log \zeta(s) expands as
\sum_p \sum_{k\ge1} \frac{1}{k p^{ks}},
and differentiating gives
-\frac{\zeta’(s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{p}\sum_{k\ge1} \log p\; p^{-ks}
= \sum_{n\ge1} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}.
The coefficient \Lambda(n) is exactly the “Bell-collapsed” sum: each prime p contributes \log p times its geometric expansion; composites appear through powers, not mixed partitions — the “atomic primes” remain distinct.

7. Future Research Pointers
	•	Dirichlet–Bell transforms. Define “Bell–Dirichlet transforms” using convolution exponentials, e.g.
\mathcal{B}f = \exp\!\left( \sum_{m\ge1} \frac{(-1)^{m+1}}{m} (f-1)^{*m}(s) \right)
and explore analytic continuations analogous to the logarithm of the zeta function.
	•	Noncommutative convolution algebras. Investigate “left” or “right” multiplicativity in algebras of arithmetic functions with non-symmetric convolution laws (useful in quantum analogues).
	•	Derivative hierarchies. Higher derivatives of Dirichlet series generate higher powers of \log n.
For instance:
\frac{d^k}{ds^k} n^{-s} = (-\log n)^k n^{-s}.
These yield logarithmic moments — crucial in the study of Stieltjes constants and in regularization of divergent zeta sums.
	•	Random multiplicative models. Assign random phases to f(p) and study the distribution of \Lambda_f and its correlations.

8. Exercises
	1.	Show that for completely multiplicative f, the function \Lambda_f(n) defined above satisfies f(n)\log n = \sum_{d|n}\Lambda_f(d)\,f(n/d).
(Hint: differentiate the Euler product termwise.)
	2.	Expand \log F(s) formally using Bell polynomials to express coefficients in terms of the sequence \{f(p)\}.
	3.	Verify that F’(s)/F(s) corresponds to the Dirichlet convolution f*\Lambda_f.
	4.	Compute the second derivative of \zeta(s) and identify the coefficients of its Dirichlet series expansion. What arithmetic function appears? (It involves (\log n)^2.)
	5.	For f(n)=n^z, compute \Lambda_f(n) explicitly and show it equals \Lambda(n) n^z.
