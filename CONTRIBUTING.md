# Contributing (short)

- Mathematics: keep derivations precise; cite sources for nonstandard claims.
- Computation: prefer Python+mpmath for prototypes; pair conjugate zeros; set precision explicitly.
- Docs: use `$...$` and `$$...$$`; avoid `#` in filenames; close all fences.

Priorities
- Verify explicit formulas for k=0,1,2.
- Stabilize P_k generation and zero-sum evaluation.
- Add concise figures/CSV outputs for Œ®_k ‚àí M_k vs truncated zero sums.
