# Handoff for Grad Student ‚Äî Von Mangoldt Hierarchies & Hasse‚ÄëStirling Work

Purpose
- Provide a short, actionable summary and checklist so you can continue the project with minimal overhead.
- Keep only what is useful: definitions, main formulas, numerical recipes, data formats, and prioritized tasks.

Core goals (short)
1. Verify and illustrate the explicit formula for $\Psi_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n)$ for small $k$ (0,1,2).  
2. Provide robust, reproducible code to compute $\Psi_k(x)$, $M_k(x)$, and a truncated zero‚Äësum.  
3. Produce figures and a short report (2‚Äì3 pages) validating the formulas and demonstrating numerical stability.

Essential definitions and formulas (keep these at hand)
- von Mangoldt hierarchies:
  $$
  (-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\Big(-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\Big)=\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s},
  $$
  and
  $$
  \Lambda_k(n)=\Lambda(n)(\log n)^k,\qquad
  \Lambda_k(p^r)=(\log p)^{k+1}r^k.
  $$
- Partial sums:
  $$
  \Psi_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n).
  $$
- Main explicit formula (structural):
  $$
  \Psi_k(x)=M_k(x)+\sum_{\rho} x^{\rho}P_k(\rho,\log x)+O(1),
  $$
  with main term
  $$
  M_k(x)=x(\log x)^k-\sum_{m=0}^k\binom{k}{m}\gamma_m\,x(\log x)^{k-m},
  $$
  and (simple zeros) polynomial factor
  $$
  P_k(\rho,\log x)=\sum_{j=0}^k(-1)^{j+1}\frac{k!}{(k-j)!}\frac{(\log x)^{k-j}}{\rho^{j+1}}.
  $$
- Normalized sums:
  $$
  S_k(x):=\frac{\Psi_k(x)}{x}= (\log x)^k - \sum_{m=0}^k \binom{k}{m}\gamma_m (\log x)^{k-m} + \frac{1}{x}\sum_\rho x^\rho P_k(\rho,\log x)+O(x^{-1}).
  $$

Optional numerical test (incomplete‚ÄëGamma fitting)
‚Ä¢ Purpose: validate the residue‚Äëcomputed polynomial \(P_k(\rho,L)\) by fitting it to incomplete‚ÄëGamma moments.
‚Ä¢ Minimal steps:
  1. For a chosen zero \(\rho\) and small \(k\), compute the residue polynomial samples \(P_k(\rho,L_m)\) at \(k+1\) distinct \(L_m=\log x_m\).
  2. Evaluate the matrix \(A_{m,j}=\partial_\alpha^j\Gamma(\alpha,L_m)\big|_{\alpha=c/\rho}\) (use high precision).
  3. Solve \(A\mathbf b=\mathbf P\) for \(\mathbf b\); compare \(\mathbf b\) with algebraic expressions derived from jets if available.
‚Ä¢ Use this test when validating P_k extraction for k ‚â§ 4 before scaling up to many zeros.

Priority checklist (do these in order)
1. Reproduce k=0 classical result (sanity check):
   - Compute $\Psi_0(x)$ by summing $\Lambda(n)$ over prime powers up to x.
   - Compare with $M_0(x)=x-\gamma x$ and include first 10 zeros.
2. Implement general $\Psi_k(x)$ routine:
   - Input: x_max, k, prime list up to x_max, zero list (first N zeros).  
   - Output: CSV with columns x, Psi_k(x), M_k(x), Error, ZeroSumApprox.
3. Generate figures:
   - Plot $\Psi_k(x)-M_k(x)$ and overlay truncated zero sum for k=0,1,2.
4. Create short writeup (figures + 1‚Äì2 pages) summarizing results, numerical stability, precision needed.

Numerical recipe (concrete, reproducible)
- Languages: Python (mpmath) or Julia (ArbFloats/MPFR). I recommend Python + mpmath for prototyping.
- Libraries: mpmath, sympy (optional), numpy, matplotlib.
- Data: Use Odlyzko zeros (first 1000) as CSV; use primes via a sieve up to x_max.
- Algorithm (pseudocode):
  1. Generate primes p ‚â§ x_max.
  2. For each prime p, for r ‚â•1 with p^r ‚â§ x_max: add (log p)^{k+1} r^k to Psi_k at indices x ‚â• p^r.
     - For efficiency: compute cumulative array via increments at positions p^r.
  3. Compute M_k(x) using precomputed Œ≥_m (use mpmath or known tables).
  4. Compute truncated zero sum: for zeros œÅ with |Im œÅ| ‚â§ T compute terms x^œÅ P_k(œÅ, log x); sum conjugates to get real part.
  5. Output CSV and plots.
- Precision guidance:
  - For x ‚â§ 1e6 and using first 50 zeros, 50‚Äì80 decimal digits is sufficient; increase precision with x and T.
- Suggested filenames:
  - scripts/compute_Psi_k.py
  - data/zeros_first_100.csv
  - results/Psi_k_x_k=0..2.csv
  - figs/Psi_k_error_k=0.png

Minimal code interface (what to implement first)
- function load_zeros(path) -> list of complex zeros
- function sieve_primes(n) -> primes
- function compute_Psi_k(x_values, k, primes) -> Psi_k array (cumulative)
- function M_k(x_values, k, gamma_list) -> M_k array
- function zero_sum(x_values, k, zeros, n_terms) -> approx array

Deliverables (for the first milestone, 2 weeks)
1. Working code that computes Psi_k and writes CSV for k=0,1,2 and x in a chosen grid (e.g., 100 points up to 1e5).  
2. Three plots (k=0,1,2) showing Psi_k - M_k and truncated zero-sum overlay.  
3. Short report (2 pages): methods, precision used, issues encountered, suggested next steps.

Notes on theory and pitfalls (short)
- The explicit formula assumes simple zeros; if multiplicities occur you must adapt residues. For computation, treat zeros as simple and flag repeats.  
- Summing x^œÅ is numerically oscillatory and best handled by pairing conjugate zeros and summing in increasing imaginary part.  
- The diagonal inversion for $(\log x)^k$ from $S_j$ is algebraic and valid because $1-\gamma_0 \ne 0$; remember to re-add the zero sum if high precision is needed.

Notes on region of convergence, Œ±‚Äëchoices for incomplete‚ÄëGamma fitting, and positivity

- Region of validity / analytic continuation:
  ‚Ä¢ The Dirichlet series definitions hold for \Re(s)>1. To use residues from zeros in the critical strip you must rely on analytic continuation of \zeta(s) and perform a contour shift from c>1 to the left. Numerically this is reflected in computing residues/local jets of the analytically continued integrand near each zero \(\rho\).

- Practical Œ±‚Äëchoices when fitting P_k with incomplete‚ÄëGamma derivatives:
  1. Try \(\alpha=-1/\rho\) and \(\alpha=1/\rho\) (or \(\alpha=c/\rho\) for small integer c). For each choice form the sampling matrix A_{m,j}=\partial_\alpha^j\Gamma(\alpha,L_m) and check its condition number.
  2. Favor Œ± values for which Re(Œ±) is not strongly negative to improve numerical stability; if necessary increase precision (mpmath dps) or use more samples L_m and regularization.
  3. Always pair conjugate zeros in later sums to form real contributions and reduce cancellation.

- Moments vs cumulants (positivity):
  ‚Ä¢ Reminder: the polynomial coefficients and Stieltjes constants are cumulant‚Äëstyle objects and may have alternating signs. Do not expect positivity as one would for raw moments of a positive measure.
  ‚Ä¢ If you need a positive sequence for modeling, apply smoothing/transforms (Borel, Bell‚Äëpolynomial smoothing, absolute‚Äëmoment reweighting) and document how they alter the analytic content.

- Quick checks for the student:
  1. For a test zero \(\rho\) and small k (‚â§3), compute P_k via local‚Äëjet residue extraction and then perform the incomplete‚ÄëGamma linear fit with two Œ± choices; compare coefficients and condition numbers.
  2. Vary sampling points L_m and radius used for Laurent extraction to ensure stability.

This is an excellent, comprehensive handoff. It clearly defines the project scope, provides all necessary mathematical context, establishes a prioritized workflow, and offers concrete technical guidance.

Here is the short, actionable summary and checklist for the graduate student.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Numerical Recipe & Guidance

### Implementation Strategy (Efficiency)

1. **$\Psi_k(x)$:** Must be computed by summing **only over prime powers** $p^r \le x$. Use an array for $\Psi_k$ and increment it at each position $p^r$.
2. **$M_k(x)$:** Requires precomputed high-precision **Stieltjes constants** $\gamma_m$. Use `mpmath`'s built-in functions or a reliable table.
3. **Zero Sum:** Sum in **conjugate pairs** (e.g., $\rho$ and $\bar{\rho}$) to ensure the result is real and to minimize numerical cancellation. Truncate at $T$ (e.g., first 50 zeros).
4. **Precision:** Use **50-80 decimal digits** (mpmath `dps`) for calculations involving zeros and $M_k(x)$, especially as $x$ increases.

### Minimal Code Interface (Implement First)

| Function | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `load_zeros(path)` | Reads list of complex zeros. |
| `sieve_primes(n)` | Generates primes up to $n$. |
| `compute_Psi_k(x_values, k, primes)` | Computes the $\Psi_k(x)$ array. |
| `M_k(x_values, k, gamma_list)` | Computes the $M_k(x)$ main term array. |
| `zero_sum(x_values, k, zeros, n_terms)` | Computes the truncated $\sum x^\rho P_k(\rho, \log x)$ approximation. |

### Pitfalls to Avoid

* **Zero Multiplicity:** Assume zeros are simple for initial computation, but be aware the formula must be adapted if multiple zeros are found (flag any known repeats).
- **Numerical Oscillation:** The term $x^\rho$ is highly oscillatory; proper precision and conjugate pairing are critical.

## üìö Suggested Reading

Focus on the following for quick reference:
- **Titchmarsh, The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function:** Chapters covering the explicit formulas.
- **Iwaniec & Kowalski:** Context on zeros and density theorems.

**Quick TODO (First 48 Hours):** Implement `compute_Psi_k` for $k=0$ and generate a baseline plot comparing $\Psi_0(x)$ against $x$. Then, implement the $M_0(x)$ and truncated zero sum for the k=0 sanity check. Email the advisor with the $k=0$ plot and any initial issues.

Quick note: P_k naming, generating function, and quick checks

- Name: call them "residue polynomials" \(P_k(\rho,\log x)\) or "zero‚Äëresidue polynomials" ‚Äî this is descriptive and avoids suggesting a fixed canonical name.
- Useful generating function (EGF in k):
  \[
  \sum_{k\ge0}\frac{t^k}{k!}\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s}
  = -\frac{\zeta'(s-t)}{\zeta(s-t)}.
  \]
  Use this shift \(s\mapsto s-t\) to test k‚Äëdependence numerically: extract residues at s=œÅ for several small t and compare Taylor coefficients in t with computed P_k.
- Why many indices: keep the notation \(c^{(k)}_m\) (k for derivative order, m for Laurent index) to avoid ambiguity‚Äîthis is bookkeeping rather than mathematical complication.
- Quick checks to implement (first week):
  1. Compute P_0,P_1 by residue extraction and verify they match direct formulas from jets.  
  2. Perform the EGF shift test for small t (e.g. t values ¬±0.01) and compare coefficients.  
  3. Fit P_k via incomplete‚ÄëGamma basis for k‚â§4 and compare with residue coefficients; record matrix condition numbers.

Practical note ‚Äî how to test the "cumulant" analogy numerically

1. Pick s>1 (e.g. s=1.5) and a truncation N (e.g. N=1e6).
2. Form weights w_n = Œõ(n)/n^s for n‚â§N (compute only prime powers).
3. Compute empirical moments m_j = sum_{n‚â§N} w_n (log n)^j for j=0..k.
4. Use Bell‚Äëpolynomial formulas to form the combinatorial cumulant Œ∫_k from the moments m_j (standard combinatorial routine).
5. Compare Œ∫_k with the Dirichlet coefficient sum S_k := sum_{n‚â§N} Œõ_k(n)/n^s (or compare partial sums Œ®_k(x) appropriately scaled). They should match within truncation/precision error.
6. Also check finite differences: evaluate K_s(t) = -Œ∂'(s-t)/Œ∂(s-t) for small t, form finite difference derivatives at t=0 and compare with Œ∫_k.

Notes:
- Use high precision (mpmath dps ‚â• 50) for steps involving Œ∂ and to reduce cancellation.
- This test validates the structural cumulant interpretation (algebraic equivalence) for s in the region of absolute convergence; residue/zero effects enter when you analytically continue or shift contours.
