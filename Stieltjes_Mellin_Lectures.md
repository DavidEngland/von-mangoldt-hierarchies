üìò Lecture 1 ‚Äî The von Mangoldt Function and Its Generating Series

1.1 The von Mangoldt Function

$$
\Lambda(n) =
\begin{cases}
\log p, & \text{if } n=p^k,\\
0, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

This function ‚Äúweights‚Äù integers by their prime power structure and lies at the core of analytic number theory.

‚∏ª

1.2 Dirichlet Generating Function

For $\Re(s)>1$,
$$
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^{s}} = -\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}.
$$
	‚Ä¢	The left-hand side encodes primes.
	‚Ä¢	The right-hand side is the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function.
	‚Ä¢	Zeros of \zeta(s) correspond to oscillations in prime density.

üí¨ Commentary

This equality acts as a ‚Äúdictionary‚Äù between primes and analytic structure.
Whenever we differentiate -\zeta‚Äô/\zeta, we generate higher ‚Äúmoments‚Äù of the von Mangoldt distribution.

‚∏ª

üß† Exercises
	1.	Show directly from the Euler product
\zeta(s)=\prod_p(1-p^{-s})^{-1}
that
-\zeta‚Äô(s)/\zeta(s)=\sum_p \frac{\log p}{p^s-1}.
Expand this to recover \sum_n \Lambda(n)/n^s.
	2.	Use the logarithmic derivative to show that primes dominate the behavior of \zeta near s=1.
	3.	Prove that \Psi(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda(n) has the same asymptotic order as x.

üìò Lecture 2 ‚Äî The von Mangoldt Hierarchies

2.1 Definition

For integer $k\ge0$:
$$
\boxed{
\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^{s}}
= (-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left[-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right]
}, \quad \Re(s)>1.
$$
	‚Ä¢	k=0: the original \Lambda(n).
	‚Ä¢	k=1: a logarithmic derivative of \Lambda(n).
	‚Ä¢	k\ge2: ‚Äúhigher cumulants‚Äù of the prime distribution.

‚∏ª

2.2 Partial Sums

$\Psi_k(x)=\sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n).$

Each \Psi_k captures a deeper layer of structure‚Äîakin to higher derivatives in probability generating functions.

‚∏ª

üí¨ Commentary

Think of -\zeta‚Äô/\zeta as a moment generating function for the primes (with respect to \log n).
Each derivative d^k/ds^k corresponds to higher-order fluctuations in prime density.

‚∏ª

üß† Exercises
	1.	Compute the first two functions explicitly:
\Lambda_0(n)=\Lambda(n), \qquad
\Lambda_1(n)= -(\log n)\Lambda(n).
Verify their Dirichlet series from the definition.
	2.	Write a short Python/MATLAB script to tabulate \Lambda_k(n) for small n.
	3.	Interpret \Lambda_k probabilistically: if primes are ‚Äúevents,‚Äù what do higher derivatives measure?

üìò Lecture 3 ‚Äî Mellin Transforms and Explicit Formulas

3.1 Mellin Transform of the Hierarchy

$$
\int_0^\infty \Psi_k(x)x^{-s-1}\,dx
=\frac{1}{s}\sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s}
=\boxed{\frac{(-1)^k}{s}\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left[-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right]}.
$$

3.2 Mellin Inversion

$$
\Psi_k(x)
=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}
\frac{(-1)^k}{s}\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left[-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right]
x^s\,ds,\quad c>1.

üí¨ Commentary

This contour integral is the exact analytic representation of \Psi_k(x).
Shifting the contour leftward (past poles and zeros of \zeta) reveals:
	‚Ä¢	A main term from s=1.
	‚Ä¢	Oscillatory terms from nontrivial zeros \rho.

That‚Äôs how analytic continuation of \zeta creates the prime oscillations in explicit formulas.

‚∏ª

üß† Exercises
	1.	Verify by partial summation that the transform identity holds for k=0.
	2.	Perform a contour shift and find the residue at s=1.
	3.	Show how nontrivial zeros \rho contribute x^{\rho} terms to \Psi_k(x).
	4.	Compute the main term for \Psi_1(x) using the first few Stieltjes constants.

üìò Lecture 4 ‚Äî The Stieltjes Constants and Their Generating Function

4.1 Definition

The Laurent expansion of $\zeta(s)$ near $s=1$ is:
$$
\zeta(1+u)=\frac{1}{u}+\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n\gamma_n}{n!}u^n.
$$

The constants \gamma_n are the Stieltjes constants.
They generalize Euler‚Äôs constant (\gamma_0=-\psi(1)) and encode zeta‚Äôs local behavior at s=1.

4.2 Exponential Generating Function

$$
\boxed{G(t)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\gamma_n}{n!}t^n
=\zeta(1-t)+\frac{1}{t}}.
$$

üí¨ Commentary

This elegant identity shows that:
	‚Ä¢	G(t) is entire (the singularities cancel at t=0);
	‚Ä¢	Its singularities correspond to the zeros of \zeta;
	‚Ä¢	Therefore, the growth and sign changes of \gamma_n reflect the zero distribution.

‚∏ª

üß† Exercises
	1.	Verify the EGF identity by substituting u=-t in the Laurent expansion.
	2.	Determine the radius of convergence of G(t) from the nearest zero of \zeta.
	3.	Compute \gamma_0,\gamma_1,\gamma_2 numerically and observe their alternating signs.

üìò Lecture
The sign pattern of \gamma_n resembles cumulant oscillations in skewed distributions.
To obtain ‚Äúpositive‚Äù analogues, one might:
	‚Ä¢	Redefine cumulants via absolute moments;
	‚Ä¢	Apply Bell polynomial smoothing;
	‚Ä¢	Consider logarithmic factorial moments of \Lambda(n).

‚∏ª

üß† Exercises
	1.	Show that if \gamma_n were all positive, \zeta(s) would lack zeros in \Re(s)>0.
	2.	Write the Bell polynomial relation between moments and cumulants, then apply it to \gamma_n.
	3.	Interpret -\zeta‚Äô/\zeta as the cumulant generating function of a discrete measure.

üìò Lecture 6 ‚Äî Connecting Hierarchies and Stieltjes

6.1 Expansion at s=1

-\frac{\zeta‚Äô(s)}{\zeta(s)}
=\frac{1}{s-1}-\sum_{n=0}^\infty \eta_n (s-1)^n,
with coefficients \eta_n polynomially expressible in the \gamma_m.

Thus,
\Lambda_k(n)\leftrightarrow
\left.\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta‚Äô(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right)\right|_{s=1}.

‚∏ª

üí¨ Commentary

The \gamma_n encode local cumulants at s=1; the \Lambda_k describe global fluctuations of primes.
Their Mellin relationship bridges these two domains‚Äîlocal analytic data vs. global arithmetic behavior.

‚∏ª

üß† Exercises
	1.	Derive \eta_n in terms of \gamma_n for n=0,1,2.
	2.	Write explicit formulas for \Psi_k(x) up to k=2 using residues of the Mellin inversion.
	3.	Show how each nontrivial zero \rho contributes a term x^{\rho} P_k(\rho,\log x).

üìò New insights and perspectives on the Stieltjes constants

1) Multiple useful viewpoints
	‚Ä¢ Cumulant/probabilistic: view the \gamma_n as cumulant-like coefficients of the local measure at s=1 via G(t)=\zeta(1-t)+1/t. This frames sign oscillations as higher-order cumulant noise and suggests probabilistic smoothing (e.g., Bell-polynomial transforms) to reveal dominant scales.
	‚Ä¢ Spectral/entire-function: treat G(t) as an entire spectral generating function; its singularities are at t=1-\rho, so patterns in \{\gamma_n\} reflect the zero spectrum. Zeros close to s=1 produce the strongest contributions to large-n behaviour.
	‚Ä¢ Asymptotic/saddle-point: large-n growth is governed by a saddle-point analysis of the EGF G(t). One expects super-exponential growth (factorial scale) modulated by oscillatory factors coming from nearby singularities; see classic saddle-point analyses for precise leading terms.

2) Exact classical representation (useful for theory and numerics)
	‚Ä¢ Limit formula:
	\[
	\gamma_n \;=\; \lim_{m\to\infty}\left(\sum_{k=1}^m\frac{(\log k)^n}{k} \;-\; \frac{(\log m)^{n+1}}{n+1}\right),
	\]
	which is often a convenient starting point for deriving identities and checking computations.

3) Numerical and stability notes
	‚Ä¢ Cancellation: direct summation for large n suffers severe cancellation; compute with high precision and prefer contour integrals or dedicated zeta-derivative routines.
	‚Ä¢ Contour methods: evaluating \gamma_n via integrals of \zeta(s) around s=1 (or using G(t) and saddle contours) is numerically superior for moderate-to-large n.
	‚Ä¢ Validation: compare independent methods (series limit, contour integral, EGF residues) and track precision growth with n.

4) Short experimental suggestions
	‚Ä¢ Plot scaled values \gamma_n / n! (or \gamma_n/(n! r^n) for a fitted r) to visualize oscillatory envelope and extract exponential scale.
	‚Ä¢ Compute the partial sums of zeros' contributions to G(t) (t near small real values) to see which zeros dominate each coefficient.
	‚Ä¢ Apply simple smoothing transforms (Borel/exponential) and test whether sign patterns become regularized.

5) Research pointers (concise)
	‚Ä¢ Pursue a probabilistic model whose cumulants match \gamma_n ‚Äî this may explain sign irregularities.
	‚Ä¢ Use spectral-analytic techniques to relate growth of \gamma_n to zero distribution statistics.
	‚Ä¢ Combine saddle-point asymptotics with rigorous error bounds for effective large-n estimates.

üß† Exercises (extra)
	1. Use the limit formula to compute \gamma_0,\gamma_1,\gamma_2 and compare with contour-integral results.
	2. Implement a small experiment: plot \gamma_n/n! for n up to 50 at increasing precision and observe the envelope and sign changes.
	3. Apply a Bell-polynomial transform to the first 20 \gamma_n and comment on any improvement in sign-regularity.
