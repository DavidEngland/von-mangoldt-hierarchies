# Notes on the Special Function g(t) for Riemann Zeta Zeros

## Theoretical Foundation

The function g(t) in our Riemann zeta zeros example serves as a critical link between the Hasse-Stirling framework and the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function. Its theoretical significance comes from several connections:

### 1. Relationship to Logarithmic Derivative

The logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function has the form:

$$\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}$$

where $\Lambda(n)$ is the von Mangoldt function defined as:
- $\Lambda(n) = \log(p)$ if $n = p^k$ for some prime $p$ and integer $k \geq 1$
- $\Lambda(n) = 0$ otherwise

Our g(t) function is attempting to approximate a kernel function such that:

$$\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \mathcal{H}_{s,-1,0}(g(t))(1)$$

### 2. Challenges in Direct Representation

Finding an exact closed-form g(t) that satisfies this equation is extremely challenging for several reasons:

1. The von Mangoldt function has a complex distribution related to prime numbers
2. The non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ create singularities in the logarithmic derivative
3. The Hasse operator representation requires a well-behaved function to achieve convergence

In our implementation, we use an approximation based on local behavior near zeros:

```python
def g_function(t, T):
    # Use the Riemann-Siegel Z function behavior near zeros
    s = complex(0.5, T + t)
    
    try:
        # Compute the logarithmic derivative
        z = mp.zeta(s)
        dz = mp.diff(lambda x: mp.zeta(x), s)
        return float(dz / z)
    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, OverflowError):
        # Fallback approximation
        return -1/t
```

### 3. Theoretical Insights from Alternative Formulations

A more rigorous approach would involve:

1. **Explicit Series Representation**: Using the Hasse-Stirling parameters $(\alpha,\beta,r) = (s,-1,0)$ and working backward to derive g(t)

2. **Approximate Kernel**: Developing a smooth approximation to the von Mangoldt function's Dirichlet series

3. **Mellin Transform Connection**: Relating g(t) to the inverse Mellin transform of a modified $\zeta'/\zeta$ function

## Practical Considerations

### 1. Numerical Stability

The current implementation has stability issues because:

- Near zeros, $\zeta(s) \approx 0$ causes division by near-zero
- The logarithmic derivative has poles at the zeros of $\zeta(s)$
- Small changes in t can cause large fluctuations in function values

### 2. Potential Improvements

Better formulations of g(t) could involve:

1. Using the Riemann-Siegel formula and its derivatives directly
2. Implementing a regularized version that avoids singularities
3. Working with a series approximation based on the first N terms of the von Mangoldt series

### 3. Asymptotic Behavior

Asymptotically, for large T (imaginary part of the zero), the function g(t) should behave like:

$$g(t) \sim \frac{1}{t} \log\left(\frac{T}{2\pi}\right) + \text{lower order terms}$$

This relates to the density of zeros according to the Riemann-von Mangoldt formula.

## Connection to the Hasse-Stirling Framework

The Hasse-Stirling framework's power for finding Riemann zeros lies in its ability to transform between:

1. The complex analytic properties of $\zeta(s)$
2. The arithmetic properties encoded in the distribution of primes
3. The combinatorial structures represented by generalized Stirling numbers

In particular, the choice of parameters $(\alpha,\beta,r) = (s,-1,0)$ relates to:

- $\alpha = s$: Connects to the complex parameter in the zeta function
- $\beta = -1$: Creates the appropriate weighting for the logarithmic structure
- $r = 0$: Simplifies the relation to avoid additional shifts

## Research Directions

Finding a better formulation of g(t) remains an open research question with connections to:

1. The explicit formula relating primes to zeta zeros
2. The functional equation of the zeta function
3. Potential new approaches to the Riemann Hypothesis

A promising direction would be to explore the relationship between the Hasse-Stirling representation and the Riemann-Siegel formula, potentially leading to more efficient computational methods and deeper theoretical insights.
