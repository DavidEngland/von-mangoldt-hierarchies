== Generalized von Mangoldt Function ==

### 1. Classical Definition

The classical von Mangoldt function $\Lambda(n)$ is defined as:
$$
\Lambda(n) = 
\begin{cases}
\log p & \text{if } n = p^k \text{ for some prime } p \text{ and integer } k \geq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
It plays a central role in analytic number theory, especially in explicit formulas for prime counting and in the study of the Riemann zeta function.

---

### 2. Generalization to Higher Powers: $\Lambda_k(n)$

The generalized von Mangoldt functions are defined by:
$$
\Lambda_k(n) = \sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) \log^k\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)
$$
where $\mu$ is the Möbius function and $k$ is a positive integer.

- For $k=1$, $\Lambda_1(n) = \Lambda(n)$ is the classical von Mangoldt function.
- For $k>1$, $\Lambda_k(n)$ involves higher powers of logarithms and encodes more refined arithmetic information.

#### Properties

- **Support:** Supported on prime powers, similar to $\Lambda(n)$, but with higher log powers.
- **Explicit formula:** For $n = p^m$ (prime power),
  $$
  \Lambda_k(p^m) = \log^k p
  $$
  for $k=1$, and more generally, involves binomial expansions for higher $k$.
- **Relation to Dirichlet series:**
  $$
  -\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^s}
  $$
  and for higher derivatives,
  $$
  (-1)^k \frac{d^k}{ds^k} \log \zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s}
  $$

#### Applications

- **Prime number theorem:** $\Lambda(n)$ appears in explicit formulas for $\psi(x)$ and $\pi(x)$.
- **Generalized explicit formulas:** $\Lambda_k(n)$ allows for higher-order explicit formulas, useful in studying moments and correlations of primes.
- **Connections to Stieltjes constants and zeta derivatives:** The coefficients in the Laurent expansion of $\zeta(s)$ at $s=1$ involve sums over $\Lambda_k(n)$.

#### Further Generalizations

- **Weighted von Mangoldt functions:** One can generalize further by considering $\sum_{d \mid n} \mu(d) f(\log(n/d))$ for suitable functions $f$.
- **Connections to L-functions:** Analogous definitions exist for Dirichlet $L$-functions and other zeta-type functions.

### 3. Logarithms of Primes as a Basis in Number Theory

The set $\{1, \log 2, \log 3, \log 5, \ldots, \log p, \ldots\}$, where $p$ runs over all primes, forms a fundamental "basis" for expressing arithmetic functions and identities in analytic number theory:

- **Prime factorization:** Any integer $n > 1$ can be uniquely written as $n = \prod_{p} p^{a_p}$, so $\log n = \sum_{p} a_p \log p$.
- **Von Mangoldt function:** $\Lambda(n)$ singles out prime powers via $\log p$.
- **Generalized von Mangoldt:** $\Lambda_k(n)$ involves powers of $\log p$, further emphasizing the role of prime logs.
- **Dirichlet series and explicit formulas:** Many key series (e.g., $\zeta(s)$, $L$-functions) and their derivatives are naturally expanded in terms of $\log p$.
- **Linear independence:** The set $\{1, \log p_1, \log p_2, \ldots\}$ is linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ (by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic).

**Implication:**  
Arithmetic functions, especially those related to prime counting, factorization, and zeta/L-functions, can be decomposed or expanded in terms of the logs of primes. This "basis" is central to analytic techniques, explicit formulas, and the study of transcendence and irrationality in number theory.

---

### 4. Irrationality and Transcendence of Logarithms of Primes

- **Fact:** For any prime $p$, $\log p$ is irrational (and in fact transcendental).
- **Reason:** If $\log p$ were rational, then $p = e^q$ for some rational $q$, which is impossible since $e^q$ is transcendental unless $q=0$.
- **Finite linear combinations:** Any nontrivial finite linear combination $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \log p_i$ with $a_i \in \mathbb{Q}$ and not all $a_i=0$ is also irrational (and transcendental unless the sum is zero).
  - This follows from the linear independence of $\{\log p_1, \log p_2, \ldots\}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.
  - If $\sum a_i \log p_i$ were rational, then $\prod p_i^{a_i}$ would be a rational power of $e$, which is impossible unless all $a_i=0$.

**Summary:**  
The set of logarithms of primes is linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$. Any nontrivial finite rational linear combination of logs of distinct primes is irrational (and transcendental).

---

### 5. Von Mangoldt Function and Transcendence Framework

The von Mangoldt function $\Lambda(n)$ and its generalizations highlight the arithmetic structure of integers via their prime factorization, especially through logarithms of primes.

- **Irrationality/transcendence:** Since $\Lambda(n)$ singles out $\log p$ for prime powers, and $\log p$ is transcendental for any prime $p$, the function naturally encodes transcendental numbers.
- **Linear independence:** The fact that $\{\log p\}$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ is central to proofs of irrationality and transcendence for expressions involving prime logs.
- **Explicit formulas:** In analytic number theory, explicit formulas involving $\Lambda(n)$ can sometimes be used to show that certain sums or series cannot be rational, by reducing them to nontrivial combinations of $\log p$.
- **Transcendence proofs:** While $\Lambda(n)$ itself is not typically used directly in transcendence proofs, its appearance in formulas and its connection to prime logs can provide the arithmetic structure needed for such arguments.

**Summary:**  
The von Mangoldt function encodes transcendental numbers via $\log p$ and their combinations. It provides a framework for expressing and analyzing numbers whose irrationality or transcendence can be deduced from the properties of prime logarithms. In practice, transcendence proofs rely on deeper results (e.g., Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem), but von Mangoldt's function helps reveal the underlying prime-based structure.

---

### 6. Generalization: Including $-1$ as a "Prime" and $\log(-1)$

To further generalize the von Mangoldt function and its basis, one can formally include $-1$ as a "prime" and use $\log(-1)$ as a placeholder:

- **Extended basis:** Consider $\{1, \log(-1), \log 2, \log 3, \ldots, \log p, \ldots\}$.
- **Motivation:** In analytic number theory, $-1$ is sometimes treated as a "unit" or "prime" in certain algebraic contexts (e.g., in $\mathbb{Z}$ or quadratic fields).
- **Placeholder:** $\log(-1)$ is not a real number, but as a formal symbol it can encode sign information or parity in expansions.
  - For example, $\log(-1) = i\pi$ in the complex plane.
- **Implications:** This extension allows for more uniform algebraic manipulations, especially when considering multiplicative functions or Dirichlet characters that take values $\pm 1$.

**Summary:**  
Including $-1$ as a "prime" and $\log(-1)$ as a formal basis element generalizes the framework for expressing arithmetic functions. This can be useful for encoding sign, parity, or complex structure in analytic number theory, though $\log(-1)$ should be treated as a formal or complex placeholder.

---

### 7. Von Mangoldt, Hasse-Stirling Operator, and Transcendence

It is possible to combine the von Mangoldt function with the Hasse-Stirling operator acting on $\log$ or powers of $\log$ to analyze transcendence:

- **Operator action:** The Hasse-Stirling operator $\mathcal{H}_{\alpha,\beta,r}$ acting on $\log(t)$ or $[\log(t)]^k$ produces sums involving $\log p$ and its powers, weighted by arithmetic functions like $\Lambda(n)$ or $\Lambda_k(n)$.
- **Transcendence framework:** Since $\log p$ and its powers are transcendental, any nontrivial sum or series produced by the operator involving these terms is transcendental unless there is cancellation.
- **Explicit formulas:** For example, applying the operator to $\log(t)$ yields expressions involving the digamma function, which itself encodes transcendental values via its connection to prime logs.
- **Proof strategy:** While not a direct proof, this framework can help reduce transcendence questions to the linear independence and transcendence of $\log p$ and its powers, leveraging the structure provided by von Mangoldt and Hasse-Stirling.

**Summary:**  
The combination of von Mangoldt and Hasse-Stirling operators acting on logarithmic functions provides a systematic way to construct transcendental numbers and analyze their properties. This approach can clarify the arithmetic structure and support transcendence proofs, especially when combined with deeper results like the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem.

### 8. Example: Von Mangoldt, Hasse-Stirling, and Transcendence

**Step 1: Operator on $\log(t)$ and von Mangoldt**

- Apply the Hasse-Stirling operator to $\log(t)$:
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}(\log t)(x-1) = \psi(x) + \gamma
  $$
- The digamma function $\psi(x)$ has an explicit formula:
  $$
  \psi(x) = \log x - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n} x^{-n}
  $$
  (Here, $\Lambda(n)$ appears directly.)

**Step 2: Transcendence via von Mangoldt**

- Each term $\Lambda(n)/n$ for $n = p^k$ is $\log p / p^k$, which is transcendental for any prime $p$.
- The sum $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n} x^{-n}$ is a (possibly infinite) linear combination of transcendental numbers.
- Unless there is cancellation, the result is transcendental.

**Step 3: Zeta Values at Integers**

- The Riemann zeta function at even integers:
  $$
  \zeta(2n) = \frac{(-1)^{n+1} (2\pi)^{2n} B_{2n}}{2 (2n)!}
  $$
  is known to be transcendental for $n \geq 1$.
- At odd integers, $\zeta(2n+1)$ is also believed to be transcendental (e.g., $\zeta(3)$ is known to be irrational), and can be computed using similar operator and series methods.

**Step 4: Same Class Argument**

- Since both even and odd zeta values are constructed from sums involving $\log p$ and related transcendental quantities, they are "in the same class" from the perspective of transcendence and arithmetic structure.
- The operator and von Mangoldt framework treat them uniformly, supporting this viewpoint.

**Summary of Example:**

The Hasse-Stirling operator acting on $\log(t)$ or its powers produces sums involving von Mangoldt and transcendental numbers. Zeta values at integers, whether even or odd, are constructed from similar ingredients and methods, and thus share the same transcendence/arithmetic class.

### 9. Gauss's Digamma Theorem at Rational Arguments

Gauss's digamma theorem gives an explicit formula for the digamma function at rational arguments:
$$
\psi\left(\frac{a}{q}\right) = -\gamma - \log(2q) - \frac{\pi}{2} \cot\left(\frac{\pi a}{q}\right) + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor (q-1)/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n a}{q}\right) \log\left(\sin\left(\frac{\pi n}{q}\right)\right)
$$
where $a$ and $q$ are positive integers with $1 \leq a < q$.

**Connection to von Mangoldt and Hasse-Stirling:**
- The digamma at rational arguments can be expressed in terms of logarithms of algebraic numbers (e.g., $\log \sin(\pi n/q)$), which are transcendental except in special cases.
- The Hasse-Stirling operator acting on $\log(t)$ or powers of $\log(t)$ can be related to the digamma function at rational arguments via explicit formulas.
- The von Mangoldt function appears in the series expansion for $\psi(x)$, and its structure is reflected in the arithmetic nature of the terms in Gauss's theorem.

**Implications:**
- Incorporating Gauss's digamma theorem allows for explicit evaluation of the operator and von Mangoldt-related sums at rational points.
- This further connects transcendence and irrationality questions to the arithmetic of logarithms and trigonometric values at rational multiples of $\pi$.

---

### 10. Equating Gauss's Digamma Theorem to the Von Mangoldt Expansion

Recall two explicit formulas for the digamma function:

**1. Gauss's theorem at rational arguments:**
$$
\psi\left(\frac{a}{q}\right) = -\gamma - \log(2q) - \frac{\pi}{2} \cot\left(\frac{\pi a}{q}\right) + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor (q-1)/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n a}{q}\right) \log\left(\sin\left(\frac{\pi n}{q}\right)\right)
$$

**2. Von Mangoldt/Hasse-Stirling expansion:**
$$
\psi\left(\frac{a}{q}\right) = \log\left(\frac{a}{q}\right) - \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n} \left(\frac{a}{q}\right)^{-n} + \gamma
$$

**Equating the two:**

- Setting these equal gives a nontrivial identity relating sums over $\Lambda(n)$ (which encode prime logs) to trigonometric and logarithmic expressions involving algebraic numbers.
- This provides a bridge between the analytic/arithmetic structure of the von Mangoldt expansion and the transcendental nature of the terms in Gauss's theorem.

**Implications:**

- The equality shows that the transcendental quantities arising from prime logs (via von Mangoldt) are deeply connected to those from trigonometric/logarithmic values at rational multiples of $\pi$ (via Gauss).
- This can be used to study the arithmetic nature, irrationality, or transcendence of such values, and to translate between different analytic representations.

**Summary:**  
Equating Gauss's digamma theorem to the von Mangoldt/Hasse-Stirling expansion at rational arguments yields identities connecting prime logarithms to trigonometric-logarithmic expressions. This highlights the unity of transcendence phenomena in analytic number theory and provides a tool for further exploration of arithmetic properties.

### 11. Alternative Perspectives on Gauss's Digamma Theorem and Basis Extensions

**Alternative proofs and perspectives:**
- Gauss's digamma theorem is usually proved using complex analysis, contour integration, and properties of the gamma function.
- However, it can also be approached via Fourier series, finite sums, and product representations of trigonometric functions, giving a different "basis" for the values at rationals.

**Basis extension:**
- The formula for $\psi(a/q)$ involves not just logs of primes, but also logs of trigonometric values at rational multiples of $\pi$:
  - $\log \sin(\pi n/q)$, $\cot(\pi a/q)$, and finite sums of cosines.
- These quantities are transcendental except in special cases, and their algebraic independence is a deep subject (related to Baker's theorem and transcendence theory).

**Basis over the rationals:**
- The set $\{1, \log p, \log \sin(\pi n/q), \pi, \cot(\pi a/q), \ldots\}$ forms a much richer basis for expressing digamma values at rationals.
- Over $\mathbb{Q}$, finite sums of such terms can represent a wide class of transcendental numbers.

**Class produced by digamma at rationals:**
- The digamma function at rational arguments produces values in the field generated by $\mathbb{Q}$, $\pi$, and logarithms of algebraic numbers (including primes and trigonometric values).
- These values are typically transcendental, except for trivial cases.
- The set of all such values is closed under addition and multiplication, but not under algebraic operations (i.e., they are not generally algebraic numbers).

**What can we say?**
- The digamma at rationals encodes deep arithmetic and transcendence properties, connecting prime logs, trigonometric functions, and special values of $L$-functions.
- Its values are built from a basis of logs of primes and logs of trigonometric values, almost always transcendental and often algebraically independent.
- The interplay between these bases reveals the unity of analytic and arithmetic phenomena, and the richness of the transcendental world.

---

### 12. Digamma Function: Fourier Series Perspective and Basis Transforms

To analyze the digamma function at rational arguments from a different basis, consider its Fourier series representation:

- The periodic Bernoulli function and the Hurwitz zeta function allow $\psi(x)$ to be written as a Fourier series for $x$ in $(0,1)$:
  $$
  \psi(x) = -\gamma - \pi \cot(\pi x) + 2 \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{\cos(2\pi n x)}{n}
  $$
- For rational $x = a/q$, the cosines become roots of unity, and the sum can be reorganized in terms of finite sums and products involving trigonometric functions at rational multiples of $\pi$.

**Implications for basis:**
- This Fourier perspective shows that the digamma at rationals is naturally expressed in terms of $\pi$, $\cot(\pi a/q)$, and finite sums of $\cos(2\pi n a/q)$, rather than just logs of primes.
- To move between bases (e.g., from prime logs to trigonometric logs), explicit transforms or identities (such as equating the von Mangoldt and Gauss expansions) are needed.

**Summary:**  
- The Fourier series basis for the digamma at rationals is distinct from the prime log basis, and transforms between these bases encode deep arithmetic information.

---

### 13. Baker's Theorem: Introduction and Implications

**Statement (informal):**
- Baker's theorem asserts that any nontrivial linear combination of logarithms of algebraic numbers, with algebraic coefficients, is transcendental unless the combination is zero.

**Implications:**
- This theorem underpins the transcendence and algebraic independence of values like $\log p$, $\log \sin(\pi n/q)$, and similar terms appearing in digamma formulas.
- It guarantees that the digamma function at rational arguments, which involves such logarithms, almost always produces transcendental values.
- Baker's theorem is a cornerstone of transcendental number theory, generalizing the Gelfond-Schneider theorem and supporting results about linear independence over $\mathbb{Q}$.

**References:**
- Alan Baker, "Transcendental Number Theory", Cambridge University Press.
- Baker, "Linear forms in the logarithms of algebraic numbers", Mathematika 13 (1966), 204–216.

**Summary:**  
Baker's theorem provides the theoretical foundation for the transcendence of digamma values at rationals and the algebraic independence of the logarithmic and trigonometric terms in their expansions.

---

### 14. Trivial Cases for Digamma Values at Rationals

The digamma function $\psi(x)$ (or $\psi(x) + \gamma$) at rational arguments is almost always transcendental, except for certain trivial cases:

- **Trivial cases:**
  - When $x = 1$, $\psi(1) = -\gamma$ so $\psi(1) + \gamma = 0$ (rational).
  - When $x$ is a positive integer $n$, $\psi(n) = H_{n-1} - \gamma$ where $H_{n-1}$ is the $(n-1)$-th harmonic number (a rational number), so $\psi(n) + \gamma = H_{n-1}$ (rational).
  - For $x$ such that $\psi(x) + \gamma$ reduces to a finite sum of rational numbers (e.g., for $x = 1/2$, $\psi(1/2) + \gamma = -2\log 2$ is transcendental, but for integer $x$ the result is rational).

- **Summary:**  
  - $\psi(x) + \gamma$ is rational only for positive integer $x$.
  - For all other rational $x$, $\psi(x) + \gamma$ is transcendental except possibly for special algebraic cancellations (which do not occur for $x \in \mathbb{Q} \setminus \mathbb{N}$).

**Implication:**  
- The only trivial (non-transcendental) cases for digamma at rationals are at positive integers, where the value is a rational harmonic number.

---

### 15. Interpretation: $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$ as Coefficients for the $\cos(\pi n a/q)$ Basis

In Gauss's digamma theorem at rational arguments,
$$
\psi\left(\frac{a}{q}\right) = -\gamma - \log(2q) - \frac{\pi}{2} \cot\left(\frac{\pi a}{q}\right) + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\lfloor (q-1)/2 \rfloor} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi n a}{q}\right) \log\left(\sin\left(\frac{\pi n}{q}\right)\right)
$$
the terms $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$ act as coefficients for the basis functions $\cos(2\pi n a/q)$.

- **Fourier perspective:** The digamma function at rational arguments is expanded as a finite sum over cosines at rational multiples of $\pi$, with coefficients given by $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$.
- **Basis analogy:** The set $\{\cos(2\pi n a/q)\}$ forms a basis for periodic functions on rationals, and the $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$ encode the arithmetic and transcendental content as weights.
- **Arithmetic structure:** These coefficients are transcendental (except for trivial cases), and their linear independence is related to deep results in transcendence theory.

**Summary:**  
- In the Fourier/basis expansion of the digamma at rationals, $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$ serve as arithmetic coefficients for the trigonometric basis $\cos(2\pi n a/q)$.
- This structure highlights the interplay between transcendental coefficients and trigonometric bases in analytic number theory.

---

### 16. Dependence of Coefficients on $q$ and Strengthening Murty's Argument

The coefficients $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$ in the Fourier expansion of the digamma function at rational arguments depend explicitly on $q$ (the denominator of the rational argument):

- **Arithmetic dependence:** For each $q$, the set $\{\log(\sin(\pi n/q)) : 1 \leq n < q\}$ consists of logarithms of algebraic numbers that vary with $q$.
- **Transcendence and independence:** Baker's theorem ensures that these coefficients are transcendental and linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$ (unless trivial).
- **Murty's argument:** Murty showed that values like $\psi(a/q)$ are transcendental except for trivial cases, using the algebraic independence of such logarithms.

**Strengthening Murty's argument:**
- By explicitly recognizing the $q$-dependence of the coefficients, one can argue that for different $q$, the sets of coefficients are algebraically independent and generate distinct transcendental fields.
- This means that the transcendence and independence of digamma values at different rationals is even stronger than previously shown: not only are individual values transcendental, but the entire collection for varying $q$ is algebraically independent.
- The structure of the Fourier expansion, with $q$-dependent transcendental coefficients, provides a robust framework for proving such results.

**Summary:**  
- The explicit $q$-dependence of the coefficients $\log(\sin(\pi n/q))$ in the digamma's Fourier expansion allows one to strengthen arguments (like Murty's) about transcendence and algebraic independence.
- For varying $q$, the digamma values at rationals generate transcendental numbers that are not only individually transcendental, but also collectively algebraically independent.

---

### 17. The Role of the Euler-Mascheroni Constant $\gamma$ in Digamma at Rational Arguments

When considering $\psi(a/q) + \gamma$ for $a$ and $q$ coprime, the Euler-Mascheroni constant $\gamma$ appears as an additive term in both the Gauss and von Mangoldt expansions.

- **Is $\gamma$ part of the basis?**
  - $\gamma$ is a universal constant, independent of $a$ and $q$.
  - It does not depend on the arithmetic of $a/q$ and is not a coefficient in the Fourier or prime log basis.
  - In expansions, $\gamma$ acts as a "shift" or offset, not as a basis element or coefficient.

- **Arithmetic nature of $\gamma$:**
  - $\gamma$ is believed to be transcendental, but its arithmetic nature is still unknown (not proven irrational or transcendental).
  - It is not expressible as a finite sum of logs of primes or trigonometric values.

- **Coprimality and $q$ prime or near prime:**
  - For $a$ and $q$ coprime, the structure of $\psi(a/q) + \gamma$ is as described: a rational part, a sum over trigonometric logs, and the constant $\gamma$.
  - If $q$ is prime or $q \pm 1$ is prime, the basis and coefficients remain as above, but the arithmetic properties of the trigonometric terms may be more tractable or have special symmetries.

**Summary:**  
- In $\psi(a/q) + \gamma$, the constant $\gamma$ is an additive offset, not a basis element or coefficient.
- The transcendence and arithmetic independence of the digamma values at rationals is unaffected by the presence of $\gamma$.
- The coprimality of $a$ and $q$, and the arithmetic nature of $q$, influence the structure and independence of the trigonometric log coefficients, but $\gamma$ remains a universal constant.

---

### 18. Hasse-Stirling Operator Acting on $\log(t)$ Evaluated at $1$

A central perspective in this discussion is the action of the Hasse-Stirling operator on $\log(t)$, evaluated at $x=1$:
$$
\mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}(\log t)(x-1) = \psi(x) + \gamma
$$
or more generally,
$$
\mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}(\log t)(x-1) = \psi(x) + \gamma
$$

**Key points:**
- This operator produces the digamma function plus Euler's constant, connecting analytic and arithmetic structures.
- When evaluated at $x=1$, it yields $\psi(1) + \gamma = 0$, the unique rational case.
- For other $x$, especially rationals, the output encodes transcendental information via the von Mangoldt expansion and trigonometric log basis.
- This viewpoint unifies the study of transcendence, explicit formulas, and special values in analytic number theory.

**Summary:**  
- The Hasse-Stirling operator acting on $\log(t)$ at $x=1$ provides a natural and elegant bridge between combinatorial, analytic, and transcendental aspects of number theory.
- It serves as a foundational tool for exploring the arithmetic nature of digamma values and related constants.

---

### 19. Coefficient Matrix for the Hasse-Stirling Operator $(1,-1,0)$

You can construct a coefficient matrix $C_{m,k}$ for the Hasse-Stirling operator $\mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}$ acting on powers of $\log(t)$, evaluated at $x=1$:

- For $m, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:
  $$
  C_{m,k} = \mathcal{H}_{1,-1,0}([\log(t)]^k)(m)
  $$
- This matrix encodes how the operator acts on the basis $\{[\log(t)]^k\}$ at integer offsets $m$.

**Example $5 \times 5$ matrix:**
| $m \backslash k$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|------------------|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0                | $C_{0,0}$ | $C_{0,1}$ | $C_{0,2}$ | $C_{0,3}$ | $C_{0,4}$ |
| 1                | $C_{1,0}$ | $C_{1,1}$ | $C_{1,2}$ | $C_{1,3}$ | $C_{1,4}$ |
| 2                | $C_{2,0}$ | $C_{2,1}$ | $C_{2,2}$ | $C_{2,3}$ | $C_{2,4}$ |
| 3                | $C_{3,0}$ | $C_{3,1}$ | $C_{3,2}$ | $C_{3,3}$ | $C_{3,4}$ |
| 4                | $C_{4,0}$ | $C_{4,1}$ | $C_{4,2}$ | $C_{4,3}$ | $C_{4,4}$ |

- Each entry can be computed explicitly using the double sum definition or recurrence for the operator.

---

### 20. Effect of Offset $r$ in the Hasse-Stirling Operator

The parameter $r$ in $\mathcal{H}_{1,-1,r}$ acts as an offset in the operator:

- Changing $r$ shifts the evaluation point, so
  $$
  \mathcal{H}_{1,-1,r}(\log t)(x-1) = \psi(x + r) + \gamma
  $$
- The offset $r$ changes the argument of the digamma function, but $\gamma$ remains the same universal constant.
- In this sense, both $r$ and $\gamma$ act as offsets, but $r$ shifts the variable, while $\gamma$ is a fixed additive constant.

**Summary:**  
- You can construct a coefficient matrix for the operator at various $m, k$.
- The offset $r$ in the operator shifts the digamma argument, but not $\gamma$ itself.
- Both $r$ and $\gamma$ appear as additive shifts, but they play different roles: $r$ is a parameter, $\gamma$ is a universal constant.

---

### 21. Recurrence for Hasse-Stirling Coefficients $(1,-1,r)$, $k=1$

For the Hasse-Stirling operator $\mathcal{H}_{1,-1,r}$ acting on $\log(t)$ (i.e., $k=1$), the coefficients $H_{m,n}$ satisfy the recurrence:
$$
H_{m,n} = H_{m-1,n-1} + \frac{m-n+r}{m+2} H_{m-1,n}
$$
with initial conditions:
- $H_{m,0} = 1$ for all $m \geq 0$
- $H_{0,0} = 1$

This recurrence allows you to compute the coefficient matrix for any offset $r$ and for $k=1$.

---

### 22. Stieltjes Perspective: First Generalized Stieltjes Coefficient and Digamma

From the Stieltjes perspective, the first generalized Stieltjes coefficient $\gamma_0(a)$ for the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$ is given by:
$$
\gamma_0(a) = -\psi(a)
$$
where $\psi(a)$ is the digamma function.

- **Interpretation:**  
  The negative of the digamma function at $a$ is precisely the first Stieltjes coefficient, connecting the analytic properties of $\zeta(s,a)$ near $s=1$ to the arithmetic and transcendence properties discussed above.
- **Implication:**  
  All transcendence and independence results for $\psi(a)$ at rational arguments directly apply to $\gamma_0(a)$, showing that the first Stieltjes coefficient at rationals is transcendental except for trivial cases.

**Summary:**  
- The Stieltjes viewpoint unifies the study of digamma and zeta expansions: the first generalized Stieltjes coefficient is just $-\psi(a)$.
- This provides a direct bridge between the operator, digamma, and Stieltjes frameworks in analytic number theory.
