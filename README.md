This repository collects notes, code and demonstrations for the von Mangoldt hierarchies: the family {Λ_k(n)} defined by successive s‑derivatives of −ζ′/ζ, their partial sums Ψ_k(x), and the residue polynomials P_k(ρ,log x) arising in explicit formulas. It contains analytic exposition, numerical recipes (Python/mpmath) and standalone HTML/JS demos (Plotly) for experiment and visualization. Quick start: run the demos in a browser (stieltjes_demo.html / von_mangoldt_demo.html) or use scripts/compute_Psi_k.py with mpmath for reproducible computations. Contributions and small reproducible experiments welcome.
