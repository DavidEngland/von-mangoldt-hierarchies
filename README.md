# von-mangoldt-hierarchies ‚Äî Repository overview & Markdown preview guide

This repository contains research notes and code for von Mangoldt hierarchies, explicit formulas, Stieltjes constants, and related computations.

Quick purpose
- Research and teaching materials (lecture notes, experiments, notebooks).
- Use this file for instructions on how to preview Markdown (especially math) consistently.

Previewing Markdown and LaTeX (recommended conventions)
- Use inline math with single-dollar signs: `$...$`.
- Use display math with double-dollar signs: `$$ ... $$`.
- If your previewer supports fenced math blocks, use:
  ```math
  \[ ... \]
  ```
  or
  ```math
  $$ ... $$
  ```
- Many Markdown previewers (GitHub, VS Code) do not render LaTeX by default. Recommended options:
  - VS Code: install the "Markdown+Math" or "Markdown Preview Enhanced" extension.
  - For interactive notebooks or web previews, use a renderer that supports MathJax/KaTeX.

Recommended editor setup
1. VS Code + Markdown Preview Enhanced (or Markdown+Math)
2. In Markdown Preview Enhanced settings enable KaTeX or MathJax rendering.
3. For high-precision numeric or LaTeX-heavy work, run snippets in Jupyter / Binder with MathJax enabled.

Common preview problems and fixes
- Unrendered math:
  - Ensure you use `$...$` (inline) or `$$...$$` (display).
  - Check previewer extension is installed and enabled.
- Unclosed code / math fences:
  - Make sure each triple-fence has a matching closing fence (```).
  - Avoid nested triple-fences inside other fences.
- HTML comments (e.g. `<!-- filepath: ... -->`) are OK in Markdown, but if placed inside a fenced code block they will display as literal text; move them above the fence.
- Filenames with special characters:
  - Avoid `#`, `%`, and other special characters in filenames (there is a docs file containing `#` in the name ‚Äî such names can break some previewers). Rename files if possible.

Quick checklist before committing Markdown:
- [ ] Every code block has a closing fence.
- [ ] Display math uses `$$ ... $$` or a supported fenced math block.
- [ ] No stray backslashes escaping Markdown characters unintentionally.
- [ ] If preview fails, open the Markdown in the recommended previewer/extension.

If you want, I can:
- produce a script to validate Markdown files for unclosed fences and common LaTeX issues, or
- propose a lightweight rename for the problematic docs file whose filename contains `#`.

# Von Mangoldt Hierarchies and Explicit Formulas

A research repository investigating the derivatives of the logarithmic derivative of the Riemann zeta function and their connections to prime number theory.

## üéØ Quick Start

**New to this research?** Start with:
1. [Student Recruitment Post](student_recruitment_post.md) - Overview and motivation
2. [Von Mangoldt Hierarchies Guide](von%20Mangoldt%20hierarchies.md) - Core mathematical definitions
3. [Handoff for Graduate Students](Handoff_for_grad_student.md) - Practical implementation guide

## üìä Research Overview

This repository explores the **von Mangoldt hierarchies** $\Lambda_k(n)$ defined by:

$$(-1)^k\frac{d^k}{ds^k}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}\right) = \sum_{n\ge1}\frac{\Lambda_k(n)}{n^s}$$

These functions generalize the classical von Mangoldt function and reveal deep connections between:
- Prime distribution and explicit formulas
- Stieltjes constants and their generating functions  
- Cumulant structures in analytic number theory
- Zeros of $\zeta(s)$ and prime oscillations

### Key Results

- **Explicit Formula**: $\Lambda_k(p^r) = (\log p)^{k+1}r^k$ for prime powers
- **Partial Sums**: $\Psi_k(x) = \sum_{n\le x}\Lambda_k(n)$ with residue expansions
- **Stieltjes Connection**: Coefficients involve Stieltjes constants $\gamma_m$

def lambda_k(p, r, k):
    """Compute Œõ_k(p^r)"""
    return (log(p)**(k+1)) * (r**k)

# Example: Œõ_2(8) = Œõ_2(2^3) = (log 2)^3 * 3^2
result = lambda_k(2, 3, 2)  # = (log 2)^3 * 9
```
